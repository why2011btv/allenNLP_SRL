      "In recent decades the greatness of these marginalized artists has become increasingly undeniable -- whether you call their work folk, primitive, amateur, naïve or, lately, outsider -- and demands have gotten louder to include them in a more flexible integrated version of modernism.\n",
      "The show's predecessors include ambitious surveys like ''Parallel Visions: Modern Artists and Outsider Art'' at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art in 1993 and ''The Encyclopedic Palace of the World,'' at the 2013 Venice Biennale.\n",
      "But ''Outliers'' is different.\n",
      "Limiting its scope to American art, it tries to map the intersections of taught and untaught over the last century, examining not only the place of self-taught art now but how it got here.\n",
      "''Outliers'' represents some five years of meticulous research by Lynne Cooke, senior curator for special projects in modern art at the National Gallery.\n",
      "It is extensive: about 280 artworks by 84 artists -- and Ms. Cooke has organized them chronologically, in three sections.\n",

      "On display are little-seen masterpieces like William H. Johnson's proto-Pop painting ''John Brown Legend,''  from about 1945 and part of the artist's final series, ''Fighters for Freedom.''\n",
      "It centers on the martyred white abolitionist as he comes down from a cross, while a black mother holds up her child to tenderly touch his face.\n",
      "Arrayed around them float emblems of religion and American history: a church, a Bible and a golden city; portraits of white men, mostly of Civil War vintage; log cabins; and a half-length portrait that may depict the artist.\n",
      "Elsewhere, the show affirms that black self-taught artists from the South created -- in context, innovation and the ability to influence -- the visual equivalent to gospel music and the blues.\n",
      "It also acknowledges the amazing run of self-taught geniuses that emerged from the late 1960s into the '90s -- from Martín Ramírez (1895-1963), the Mexican laborer who created his world of caballeros, arcades and Madonnas in a mental hospital in Northern California from the late 1940s to the early '60s, to James Castle (1899-1977), a deaf-mute artist who depicted the world of his family's Idaho farms (including his own art) in many shades of gray, and Morton Bartlett (1909-1992), known for his photographs of his anatomically correct child mannequins.\n",
      "And you'll find juxtapositions of taught and self-taught artists that are, for the most part, mutually illuminating in their forms and themes.\n",
      "Ms. Cooke's show is about art, but also exhibitions of art.\n",
      "She measures the art-world's inconsistent attention to self-taught art in terms of the ebb and flow of group exhibitions in museums and elsewhere.\n",
      "This befits, she writes in the catalog, a ''field whose history has been fundamentally shaped by exhibitions.''\n",
      "''Outliers'' opens with a two-walled area featuring four artists, carefully, and promisingly, positioning together taught and self-taught artworks of relatively recent vintage united by color, found materials and a degree of abstraction.\n",
      "Three works by the outsider sculptor Judith Scott (1943-2005), known for creating evocative misshapen presences by wrapping found objects in layers of yarn , share a low platform with the work of the mainstream artist Nancy Shaver, whose delicate assemblage-boxes covered with found papers and fabrics, resemble folk-art updates.\n",
      "An airy assemblage by Jessica Stockholder, also mainstream, takes elegant charge of one wall.\n",
      "On another hangs a large provocative quilt by Rosie Lee Tompkins (1936-2006) made of found fabrics, including segments of an American flag and towels, one depicting Jesus.\n",
      "It has the bold color and scale of a James Rosenquist Pop art painting.\n",
      "That is just the overture.\n",
      "Because of the volume of material here, it's best to view the show the way Ms. Cooke intended, by tackling the three periods chronologically.\n",
      "1924 to 1943: Folk Aesthetics Reconfigured  This section traces the growing understanding of folk art's formal simplicity as implicitly modern.\n",
      "It includes the work of trained artists who were early appreciators, among them, Charles Sheeler, Yasuo Kuniyoshi, Marsden Hartley, Florine Stettheimer and Elie Nadelman.\n",
      "There are also unfamiliar works that mesmerize, including two from around 1930: ''Adam and Eve and the Garden,'' a carved wood tableau by José Dolores López that buzzes with medieval sprightliness, and Palmer Hayden's ''Untitled (Dreamer),'' which depicts a black man sleeping in a pose and simplified style reminiscent of both Henri Rousseau and Paul Gauguin.\n",
      "The man's head rests sweetly on a fringed pillow, while a trumpet, a guitar and a drum are played by disembodied hands.\n",
      "The Museum of Modern Art collected and exhibited some of the self-taught artists found here under the leadership of its founding director, Alfred H. Barr Jr. -- a folk-art true believer.\n",
      "Perhaps the most surprising is the presence of work by Edward Hicks, the early-19th-century Quaker painter of sentient animals, including a ''Peaceable Kingdom,'' from about 1834, similar to the one the Modern once owned.\n",
      "At times the allegiance to chronology curtails chances to surprise.\n",
      "Lonnie Holley's wonderful 1985 sculpture in carved sandstone is marooned just outside the show; it should have been with its (mostly) 1930s precursors, among the carved stone sculptures of William Edmondson and John B. Flanagan whose pairing is by now a bit tired.\n",
      "And there are strange missed opportunities: ''Milky Way,'' a luminous dripped-paint abstraction from 1945 by the self-taught Ukrainian-American artist Janet Sobel, should have been paired with one by Jackson Pollock (who was aware of her work).\n",
      "But Ms. Cooke consistently skirts canonical figures; her vanguard artists are also in different ways outliers, except for art stars like Kara Walker and Cindy Sherman, both of whom appear later without much justification, though Ms. Sherman collects and has written about some of the outsider photographers grouped around her.\n",
      "1968-1992: Commensurables and Incommensurables  The second section gives the show a combustible center; its title alludes to the debate over whether self-taught artists could be compared to trained ones or are incomparable.\n",
      "''Outsider art'' supersedes ''folk art,'' connoting a more jarring, free-range aesthetic usually from outside the Northeast, as demonstrated here.\n",
      "Starting in an almost too spacious gallery this section contains the most intense visual conversations between taught and self-taught.\n",
      "First, it's between the idiosyncratically figurative Chicago Imagists (Roger Brown, Jim Nutt, Gladys Nilsson) and some of the outsider greats they discovered, recovered or championed: Ramírez, Joseph Yoakum and P.M. Wentworth.\n",
      "The back and forth between Brown's meticulous landscape forms and Yoakum's is especially rewarding.\n",
      "Next, there is also a dialogue regarding visceral materials and sometimes painful themes between self-taught and taught African-American artists.\n",
      "The first group gained wider attention with ''Black Folk Art in America: 1930-1980,'' a landmark exhibition at the Corcoran Gallery of Art in 1982.\n",
      "They included David Butler (1898-1997), who fashioned animals, angels and people from cut and painted tin and other found items; the religious painter Sister Gertrude Morgan (1900-1980); Steve Ashby (1904-1980), who made raw figurative assemblages out of scavenged materials; and Elijah Pierce (1892-1984), whose carved and painted wood reliefs depict biblical scenes and national figures like the Rev.\n",
      "Martin Luther King Jr.  Then the show turns to work by the second group, an imposing cadre of trained artists working in Los Angeles like Betye Saar, John Outterbridge, Senga Nengudi and Noah Purifoy, who worked for decades at the margins of the mainstream, exploring aspects of assemblage and found materials as well as political expression in often abstract forms.\n",
      "1998-2013: Determining Difference Differently  The show starts to unravel as it rushes through its final section, despite the title's koan-like optimism.\n",
      "Mr. Holley's two delicate assemblages may make you yearn for something bigger and more ferocious from this versatile Southern outsider, and also for the obstreperous painted or rusted metal reliefs by his friend Thornton Dial, who is inexplicably absent.\n",
      "Two formally educated artists especially make sense in the ''outlier'' zone.\n",
      "One is Greer Lankton, whose drawings, photographs and dolls allude to her transition to womanhood and celebrate various glamorous icons, including the first lady Jacqueline Kennedy, who remains unforgettably elegant amid tragedy, in the famous pink Chanel suit she wore on Nov.\n",
      "22, 1963.\n",
      "The other is Matt Mullican, whose large drawings on paper-backed bedsheets covered with numbers, words and images has a ''drawing in tongues'' quality, and were partly achieved through hypnosis.\n",
      "It is however unclear what -- besides being two-sided -- his work has to do with the big watercolors of the towering outsider talent Henry Darger (1892-1973), whose illustrated epic about the Vivian Girls used enlarged images from children's coloring books and would be better compared with Warhol.\n",
      "In the last gallery you can revel in the vibrant geometric quilts of Mary Lee Bendolph and Annie Mae Young, who emerged in the rapturously received exhibition ''The Quilts of Gee's Bend,'' which toured the country in 2002.\n",
      "Also here are two more quilts, made of small irregular squares of color, by the great Rosie Lee Tompkins.\n",
      "Ms. Tompkins may belong to the string of geniuses who emerged in the last three decades of the 20th century.\n",
      "But who knows, there always seem to be more, expanding and improving the story of American art.\n",
      "Looking for More Information?\n",
      "Here's a History  The first section of ''Outliers and American Vanguard Art'' includes a memorable glimpse of the MoMA's early devotion to self-taught artists.\n",
      "This involvement is known, but seeing it made flesh with wonderful works of art is a different order of magnitude -- at once exciting and saddening.\n",
      "We see a museum that might have been: more open and democratic, less bound up in the rigid Francophile narrative that defined the Modern in the later decades of the 20th century.\n",
      "Barr, the museum's founding director, viewed self-taught and educated art as equally essential to 20th-century modernism.\n",
      "Ultimately, this didn't sit well with the museum's blue-blooded trustees, and it was among the main reasons he was fired in 1943.\n",
      "Barr, who might well have embraced the ''outliers'' term, is the de facto hero of Ms. Cooke's National Gallery exhibition: a historic figure and early adopter of the integration that her exhibition proposes.\n",
      "It's enticing to consider how different the Modern and the art world might be had his directorship continued.\n",
      "''Outliers'' and its predecessors might not even have been necessary.\n",
      "During the 1930s and early 1940s, Barr and his curatorial staff mounted several shows of self-taught artists and included them in more general exhibitions.\n",
      "Rousseau, the French naïve painter who is represented in ''Outliers'' by three silent, hallucinatory canvases, was arguably the cornerstone of Barr's self-taught faith.\n",
      "An American favorite was John Kane, known for his dense paintings of life and industry in and around Pittsburgh, like the one in ''Outliers,'' and also for his startling 1929 self-portrait.\n",
      "One of six Kanes still in the Modern's collection, it shows a bare-chested strongman going soft, seemingly deified by three thick white bands that frame his head.\n",
      "One of the ''MoMA-owns-this?''\n",
      "surprises in ''Outliers'' is Dominique-Paul Peyronnet's ''The Ferryman at Moselle,'' from around 1934.\n",
      "This polished vignette freezes forever a moment from World War I: its protagonist has just cut the ferry's rope, capsizing his boat and its load of German soldiers while others watch from the bank.\n",
      "A great artist who got away is also here: a dozen of Bill Traylor's taut silhouettes of town and farm life.\n",
      "Barr tried to buy a group of Traylors in 1941 for such a pittance that his offer was spurned.\n",
      "No one gets every great thing that comes along, not even Alfred Barr.\n",
      "In 1941, a new installation of the museum's permanent collection began with a gallery of ''modern primitives,'' but Barr's time was running out.\n",
      "One of the last straws was an exhibition of the paintings of the retired tailor Morris Hirshfield, represented in ''Outliers'' by ''Girl With Pigeons'' (1942), which shows a statue-like figure reclining on a splendid red couch.\n",
      "Today the most prominent vestige of Barr's folk-art advocacy is Rousseau's work, such a familiar part of the Modern's identity that it barely registers as ''self-taught.''\n",

      "In my junior year of college, before I’d learned much about feminism, I became fascinated by what we now call the 1970s “golden era” of pornography.\n",
      "Porno chic!\n",
      "Clitoral orgasms!\n",
      "A little film called “Deep Throat”!\n",
      "Being a lusty, modern woman, I was enthralled.\n",
      "I resolved to write my senior thesis on the role of that period in changing sexual mores.\n",
      "And then, pretty quickly, I was confused.\n",
      "Was pornography a vanguard of sexual freedom or a tool of the patriarchy?\n",
      "Caught in a dizzying tangle of opinions from Second Wave feminist writers, many of whom were deeply ambivalent about the fruits of the sexual revolution, I sought guidance from my mother, the journalist and critic Ellen Willis, who in a 1981 essay in The Village Voice asked a question that now looms over #MeToo 40 years later: “Is the Women’s Movement Pro-Sex?\n",
      "”  She enlightened me to a strain of early radical feminism that would forever change my thinking on the importance of pleasure politics.\n",
      "Both pornography and men could be misogynistic and predatory, she told me.\n",
      "But they weren’t the causes so much as the symptoms of a sexist society.\n",
      "And the answer wasn’t sexual repression.\n",
      "Women’s liberation should not be “about fending off men’s sexuality,” she said, “but being able to embrace your own”.\n",
      "My connection to this complex intellectual heritage is at the heart of why I find the prevailing narrative about #MeToo’s generational split baffling and harmful.\n",
      "Here’s how the story goes: Older critics, flattened into “Second Wave feminist has-beens,” are accusing the movement of becoming increasingly anti-sex, anti-agency and anti-nuance.\n",
      "Younger women, also known as “Twitter feminists,” are accusing these critics of being bitter establishmentarians, unable to cede ground to new ideas.\n",
      "They’re both wrong, but so is this tired mothers-and-daughters framing, which threatens to derail substantive debate in favor of a catfight narrative.\n",
      "There are real reasons younger and older women may be experiencing this moment differently.\n",
      "To the extent that there is a generational divide, it may reflect many older women’s wariness of the internet, which leads them to not only miss the context of a feminist internet tradition of ironic misandry but also to overlook the more nuanced chatter happening among younger women on social media and digital sites.\n",
      "Second Wave feminism’s reputation, meanwhile, as a humorless group of mainstream white women is due partly to a deliberate attempt in the 1980s to disparage feminists, but also to the movement’s race and class blind spots.\n",
      "Add that to a perennial pastime of hating on that nebulous group called millennials and we have the makings of what, on the surface, can be read as a generational feud.\n",
      "And yet most of the disagreement has to do with ideas about sex, power and the function of social movements — disputes that have divided feminists for decades.\n",
      "There have always been liberal feminists, from Betty Friedan to Sheryl Sandberg, who wanted a seat at the table rather than to reset the table, who seek equal opportunity within existing power structures.\n",
      "They include older feminists, who endured pats on the bottom to succeed in the workplace and who urged the movement to prioritize things like women’s economic empowerment rather than sexuality, which they considered frivolous and distracting.\n",
      "But there are younger feminists, too, who wish #MeToo would focus on predetermined bad behavior, like rape, rather than rethink tolerated behavior, like sexual pressure, and bristle at suggestions of a connection between the two.\n",
      "And there have always been radical feminists, who want to see the system upended.\n",
      "In fact, the most famous radicals were Second Wave feminists, and some of their work provided the blueprint for #MeToo.\n",
      "Catharine MacKinnon was an early architect of sexual harassment’s legal definition (and has publicly supported today’s movement).\n",
      "Susan Brownmiller’s book “Against Our Will” popularized the crucial concept of rape as power.\n",
      "Of course, this wing of radical feminism veered into cries of censorship and victimhood, endorsing a sexual moralism disturbingly similar to the religious right.\n",
      "But what both activists and their critics are missing is that if #MeToo draws on the work of Ms. MacKinnon and Ms. Brownmiller, it’s also rooted firmly in the tradition of the other radical Second Wavers.\n",
      "These women were absolutely pro-sex, pro-pleasure and pro-freedom.\n",
      "“We’ve got to learn to sleep with people because we want them,” one woman said in a consciousness-raising session transcribed by the author of “The Dialectic of Sex,” Shulamith Firestone, in 1968.\n",
      "“Not to prove anything to them, not to make them feel better about their masculinity, not out of weakness or inability to say no, but simply because we want to”.\n",
      "But they also understood that if rape and harassment were political, so was bad sex.\n",
      "In a 1980 essay, the radical feminist Alix Kates Shulman remembered that in those early sessions, “sex was a central and explosive subject to which we continually returned”; feminists “used their sexual discontents to help them understand the power relations between men and women”.\n",
      "I was reminded of this history when the website Babe published its Aziz Ansari article in January.\n",
      "The account of the so-called bad date, during which Mr. Ansari is alleged to have badgered a woman into going further than she wanted to, was an example of reckless reporting and was cited by many as #MeToo’s too-far moment.\n",
      "But the instinct that it was an important article was correct.\n",
      "The issue of consensual yet joyless and unsatisfying sex was the same one my mom and her friends were grappling with 50 years ago.\n",
      "At bottom, #MeToo is not about hashtags or individual firings.\n",
      "It’s a chance to reset the table of sexual politics — not by infantilizing women or declaring a war on flirting or administering litmus tests, but by continuing a decades-long push for true equality in the bedroom, for a world in which women are not intimidated or coerced into sex but are also not stuffed into the role of gatekeepers.\n",
      "For such a movement, the history of Second Wave pro-sex feminism should serve as both North Star and cautionary tale.\n",
      "Ultimately, the arguments of these women got swallowed up by the more coherent, consistent narrative of sexual conservatism, and later by a largely depoliticized version of pro-sex feminism that presented hot-pink dildos as the key to liberation.\n",
      "One reason this might have happened is that amid these conversations, men were at best ancillary and at worst demonized, an understandable impulse in the 1970s, when the most basic feminist ideas were scary and radical.\n",
      "“A free woman needs a free man,” a woman said in a rare moment of clarity during that same 1968 consciousness-raising session.\n",
      "But there may be a deeper reason this history has been obscured.\n",
      "In a 1982 essay, my mother admits that a misstep of the early pro-sex feminists was “the failure to put forward a convincing alternative analysis of sexual violence, exploitation and alienation”.\n",
      "The burgeoning movement, in other words, didn’t make a compelling enough argument for freeing women’s sexuality rather than tamping down men’s, a distinction that makes clear the connection between bad sex and rape culture, between Harvey Weinstein’s monster and Aziz Ansari’s Everyman.\n",
      "Instead, just a few years later, protection from violence became the narrow, defensive definition of feminist sexual politics, and the concept of pleasure became synonymous with narcissism and self-indulgence.\n",
      "This is the time to rectify all that.\n",
      "Condemning a culture that excuses sexual assault and harassment isn’t about weakness and victimhood.\n",
      "It’s about what my mom, who died in 2006, scrawled on a pamphlet from the famous 1982 Barnard Conference on Sexuality, which she mailed to me while I was toiling on my thesis.\n",
      "On it, she’d written this plain but transformative note: “Feminism is a vision of active freedom, of fulfilled desires, or it is nothing”.\n",

      "CHARMING, modest and funny are not words usually associated with Lars von Trier, but they are exactly right for his playful new comedy, ''The Boss of It All.''\n",
      "Made in just five weeks, and set mostly in an office building, the film follows a doofus actor hired to masquerade as the owner of a company whose employees have never set eyes on him.\n",
      "Such an engaging film is not what anyone would expect from this Danish director whose international breakthrough came in 1996 with the glorious but emotionally grueling ''Breaking the Waves'' and who more recently made two bleak, stylized films set in Depression-era America, ''Dogville'' (2003) and ''Manderlay'' (2005).\n",
      "This is typical of Mr. von Trier: His work-in-progress, ''Antichrist,'' posits a world created by Satan rather than God, and in an interview this month with a Danish newspaper he said he had been treated for depression in a hospital early this year and doesn't know when he'll be ready to work again.\n",
      "Against this cheerless backdrop ''The Boss of It All'' (which opened on Wednesday) makes sense.\n",
      "It puts Mr. von Trier in a great tradition of directors who have been freed artistically by making little movies at strategic points in their careers, films that paradoxically often turn out to be better than their overtly ambitious, budget-bloated works.\n",
      "Francis Ford Coppola's new movie, his first in a decade, is the $5 million independently financed ''Youth Without Youth.''\n",
      "The intellectual and philosophical themes in this World War II-era story, with Tim Roth as a professor grappling with the origins of language, would almost have to make it a smaller work.\n",
      "That sounds like a relief to Mr. Coppola, who has said he had been inspired by his daughter, Sofia, to make personal films after years of dealing with studios to make money on commercial works like ''The Rainmaker,'' his 1997 adaptation of the John Grisham novel.\n",
      "(Sony Pictures Classics recently bought ''Youth Without Youth'' and plans to release it in the United States late this year.\n",

      "The ease and liveliness of ''After Hours'' comes through even now, as Griffin Dunne crawls through a New York night during which nothing goes right.\n",
      "Mr. Scorsese may even have established the pattern -- one for the studios, then one for himself -- that directors like Steven Soderbergh have followed.\n",
      "Mr. Soderbergh sandwiched two extraordinarily inventive films between ''Oceans 12'' (2004) and ''Oceans 13'' (which opens June 8).\n",
      "The minuscule, digitally shot ''Bubble'' is like a fine short story; running all of 73 minutes, it follows the emotional tangle of workers in a spooky Ohio doll factory.\n",
      "The lush, black-and-white homage to '40s movies, ''The Good German,'' may have been too stiff to work, but it was an intriguing experiment worth trying.\n",
      "Mr. von Trier has never made popcorn movies, but he still needed to shake up his career, especially after ''Dogville'' and ''Manderlay.''\n",
      "Two parts of a projected trilogy, ''U.S.A. -- Land of Opportunities,'' they evoked such fierce responses that he was lionized by some for his daring and artistry, and reviled by others as an anti-American fraud.\n",

      "There is no reason to reject this dark vision of American morality and redemption just because it comes from a Dane.\n",
      "''Manderlay,'' which brings Grace (now played by Bryce Dallas Howard) to an Alabama town where slavery still exists in 1933, is an ambitious failure.\n",
      "Where Ms. Kidman glows with inner radiance and delivers lines with the eloquence of an experienced stage actress, Ms. Howard recites speeches stiffly.\n",
      "Americans have a more complicated sense of our racist history than this incendiary film conveys, but Mr. von Trier didn't deserve to be attacked for trying.\n",
      "No wonder he has abandoned the proposed third part of the trilogy, ''Wasington.''\n",
      "(Now we may never know why he dropped that H from Washington.\n",
      ")  After this the lighthearted ''Boss of It All'' seems to come out of nowhere.\n",
      "It begins with sly self-reference as we see Mr. von Trier behind the camera, his distant image reflected in the windows of a high-rise office building.\n",
      "He says this is a comedy ''not worth a moment's reflection,'' with ''no preaching or swaying of opinion,'' and asks ''Why not poke fun at artsy-fartsy culture?''\n",
      "These comments sound like some pre-emptive rebuttal for those who find his films heavy going.\n",
      "Yet ''The Boss'' quickly gets past that defensiveness, and simply allows us to be amused by Kristoffer, a self-important bad actor who has been hired by Ravn, the owner of a technology company who has always pretended to be the manager so he can foist off unpopular decisions on his phantom boss.\n",
      "This sounds like a recipe for a French farce, which the film sometimes resembles.\n",
      "The office is crammed with neurotics, including a woman who screams in horror whenever she starts the copying machine.\n",
      "Because of the real boss's manipulations, the fake finds himself trapped into making a marriage proposal to one employee and being seduced by another.\n",
      "Despite the opening disclaimer, though, this trifle is also a wily examination of art and control, with Ravn the symbolic director trying to keep Kristoffer the actor from running amok with his own ideas.\n",
      "And artistic control is more than a casual theme for Mr. von Trier, who constantly transforms obstacles into aesthetic choices.\n",
      "That was the game behind the Dogma '95 filmmakers' manifesto, which he helped mastermind, and which forbade such flourishes as artificial lighting.\n",
      "It was the theme of his dazzling ''Five Obstructions'' (2003), with the Danish director Jorgen Leth remaking one of his short films several ways, following draconian rules set by Mr. von Trier.\n",
      "(No scene longer than 12 frames is one of them.\n",
      ") ''I want that feeling of a tortoise on its back,'' Mr. von Trier tells Mr. Leth in that film, speaking just as much about the challenges he has thrived on to inspire his own creativity.\n",
      "In making ''The Boss of It All,'' Mr. von Trier played one especially silly trick on himself.\n",
      "He filmed in what he calls Automatavision, positioning the camera then letting a computer choose when to move within a shot.\n",
      "Viewers won't notice; the film merely looks like a fly-on-the-wall documentary without the jittery feel of a handheld camera.\n",
      "The important obstacle, which his voice breaks in halfway through to comment on, is more telling and productive: to follow the rules of comedy.\n",
      "Ravn plans to sell the company and get rid of his band of neurotics.\n",
      "Can Mr. von Trier abide by the rules that say a comedy must lead to a happy ending?\n",
      "You don't need to know how it ends to see that ''The Boss of It All'' was a freeing step for him creatively.\n",
      "And for his fans this small, unexpected delight will just have to hold us while we're waiting for the Antichrist.\n",

      "BREEZING past East Village dive bars on a recent Friday night, a stylish young woman and her banker boyfriend ducked into Gemma, the Bowery Hotel's bustling new Italian-style restaurant.\n",
      "Until now, the hotel has been visited mainly by in-the-know New Yorkers sharing low-key conversation in the Lobby Bar.\n",
      "But with the opening of Gemma on July 9, it seems destined to become the more accessible cousin of the Waverly Inn, the West Village hideaway.\n",
      "Brought to you by Eric Goode and Sean MacPherson, the people behind the ''don't choose us, we'll choose you'' Waverly, Gemma takes reservations only for hotel guests, though anyone who can elbow in is welcome at the bar.\n",

      "''It's a sign of success when industry people want to hang out in your restaurant,'' said an employee of Balthazar who did not want her name used as she was not authorized to speak for the restaurant.\n",
      "''It usually means the staff is fun and the drinks come quickly.''\n",
      "Once settling up, some patrons wandered down a corridor to the Lobby Bar, a music-free space that recalls old New York with dim lamps, wooden ceiling fans and tapestries.\n",
      "A couple snuggled up and sipped Champagne, while larger groups languished on leather couches and velvet benches or in the gated outdoor patio.\n",
      "''It has a certain charm that you don't normally get in the East Village,'' said Tim Trevathan, who lives in Brooklyn.\n",

      "The election on Sunday in Turkey gave a substantial victory in Parliament to the governing Muslim pro-Western party, which promised more moderation and prosperity.\n",
      "But on the margins, more hard-line sentiments surfaced, posing a potential obstacle to this country's progress.\n",
      "The Nationalist Action Party, which appeals to voters on the far right, who fiercely defend the integrity of Turkey's borders, received 14 percent of the vote, enough to enter Parliament after failing in the past election.\n",
      "The party plays on fears, which reach back to the fall of the Ottoman Empire, that Western powers seek to carve up the country.\n",
      "It gained momentum in recent months when militant Kurdish separatists stepped up killings of Turkish soldiers in the country's southeast.\n",
      "The recent surge in foreign investment into Turkey's growing economy is also cause for alarm among its supporters.\n",
      "''Our country is about to be broken into pieces, and we need to prevent it,'' said a textile worker, wearing a button-down black shirt in the style of Italian Fascists often worn by hard-line nationalists here.\n",
      "''There are three things -- my country, my flag, my prayer.\n",
      "I can't let anyone touch any of them.''\n",
      "The killings of an Armenian journalist and of three Christian evangelists this year were both nationalist-driven crimes.\n",
      "At the same time, the election swept at least 23 Kurdish candidates into Parliament, a significant victory for Kurds, nearly a fifth of Turkey's population.\n",
      "They have not been represented on a national level in more than a decade, since a deputy was ejected from Parliament when she spoke Kurdish during a swearing-in ceremony.\n",
      "The Kurds could not be further apart from the nationalists, and many Turks said they could not imagine how the two groups would sit in the same room, never mind hold negotiations.\n",
      "This is especially the case because many of the Kurdish politicians openly admire the  Kurdish separatist Abdullah Ocalan, who led the militant Kurdistan Worker's Party in a violent fight against the Turkish Army for years and who is now in a Turkish prison.\n",
      "For the nationalists, Mr. Ocalan is Turkey's top terrorist enemy.\n",
      "The central gimmick in the nationalists' campaign platform was holding up a rope in a mock fight over who would get the honor of hanging him.\n",
      "Despite the Kurds' open support of Mr. Ocalan, the Kurdish deputies could be an important group for Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whose Justice and Development Party received about 340 of 550 seats.\n",
      "Together they could come close to the 367 required to make constitutional amendments.\n",
      "Kurds ran as independents to bypass a 10 percent hurdle to get into Parliament, resulting in the largest number of independent candidates in Turkish history.\n",
      "Ferhat Kentel, a sociologist at Bilgi University who recently conducted a study on Turkish nationalism for the Turkish Economic and Social Studies Foundation, found that extreme nationalists are bewildered by the recent changes and unable to find a footing in the economy.\n",
      "He said the nationalist party, once in Parliament, might overcome its sense of being lost and unrepresented.\n",
      "''Violence is the tool of the weakest political actors,'' he said.\n",
      "''You resort to violence when you have no more words left.''\n",
      "At a polling station in a nationalist neighborhood on the outskirts of Istanbul, a thin young man, a member of the nationalist party, spoke in an intense, emphatic tone on Sunday of his excitement for the party's expected success.\n",
      "''Now we have pens,'' he said, pulling one from his pocket and jabbing it in the air.\n",
      "The Kurds may be experiencing a similar relief.\n",
      "In a poor Kurdish neighborhood in Istanbul on Monday, men playing cards in a teashop agreed that the new Kurdish candidates would give voice to Kurdish woes.\n",

      "The feud between the media titan Sumner M. Redstone and his daughter, Shari, took another twist yesterday when a cutting letter by Mr. Redstone about his daughter was published online and she responded with a statement that she would be willing to consider selling her share of the family business.\n",
      "Mr. Redstone, the chairman and controlling shareholder of Viacom and CBS, sent the letter to a Forbes magazine reporter just a day after striking a conciliatory note in his frayed relationship with his daughter, once considered his heir apparent to the media empire.\n",
      "The rift between Mr. Redstone and his daughter, who serves as vice chairman of both companies, has thrown into question who will one day inherit the control of those media empires.\n",
      "Mr. Redstone's letter, posted on the magazine's Web site (www.\n",
      "forbes.com), said that the issue between them was who should control the companies after him.\n",
      "''While my daughter talks of good governance,'' he wrote,  ''she apparently ignores the cardinal rule of good governance that the boards of the two public companies, Viacom and CBS, should select my successor.''\n",
      "He also dismissed any contribution from his children to the success of his empire.\n",
      "He wrote that he gave his children stock in the companies but that ''it is I, with little or no contribution on their part, who built these great media companies with the help of the boards of both companies.''\n",
      "In a response released late yesterday, Ms. Redstone said that it was unfortunate that her father had chosen to publicize what she ''hoped would remain a private family matter,'' and called herself ''one Redstone family member who does not aspire to power or covet titles.''\n",
      "The strong language of Mr. Redstone's letter yesterday suggests that his relationship with his daughter has deteriorated further, but Ms. Redstone's response seemed to open the door to possible negotiations in which he would buy out her stake in National Amusements, which has controlling shares of Viacom and CBS.\n",
      "In an interview yesterday, Mr. Redstone said:  ''My position is that there is nothing that would prevent me from acting in the interests of the shareholders and thereby following the rules of good governance pursuant to which the boards of these two public companies would select my successor without having any individual imposed on them.''\n",
      "In his letter, Mr. Redstone wrote that he was ''perfectly satisfied''  to leave the situation as is -- he controls 80 percent of the stock in National Amusements, and his daughter holds 20 percent  -- but that ''if Shari desires to be bought out, I will consider this as long as the price is acceptable.''\n",
      "One arrangement that has been discussed is his buying her stake in exchange for ownership of the family's movie theater chain.\n",
      "That solution seemed like a stronger possibility after Ms. Redstone's statement yesterday.\n",

      "Prince exults in ''The One U Wanna C,'' a come-on from his new album, ''Planet Earth'' (Columbia).\n",
      "There's no reason to disbelieve him.\n",
      "With a sponsorship deal here and an exclusive show there, worldwide television appearances and music given away, Prince has remade himself as a 21st-century pop star.\n",
      "As recording companies bemoan a crumbling market, Prince is demonstrating that charisma and the willingness to go out and perform are still bankable.\n",
      "He doesn't have to go multiplatinum -- he's multiplatform.\n",
      "Although Prince declined to be interviewed about ''Planet Earth,'' he has been highly visible lately.\n",
      "His career is heading into its third decade, and he could have long since become a nostalgia act.\n",
      "Instead he figured out early how to do what he wants in a 21st-century music business, and clearly what he wants is to make more music.\n",
      "Despite his flamboyant wardrobe and his fixation on the color purple, his career choices have been savvy ones, especially for someone so compulsively prolific.\n",
      "Like most pop stars, he goes on major tours to coincide with album releases,  which for Prince are frequent.\n",
      "But he also gets out and performs whenever he chooses.\n",
      "Last year he took over a club in Las Vegas and renamed it 3121, after his 2006 album ''3121,'' which briefly hit No.\n",
      "1 and spawned multiple conflicting theories about the significance of the number.\n",
      "He started playing there twice a week for 900 people at $125 a ticket.\n",
      "In February he had an audience in the millions as the halftime entertainment for the Super Bowl.\n",
      "He has gone on to play well-publicized shows at the Roosevelt Hotel in Hollywood for a few hundred people paying $3,121 per couple, and another elite show last weekend  in East Hampton for about $3,000 per person.\n",
      "Meanwhile Verizon put Prince in commercials that use ''Guitar,'' another song from ''Planet Earth,'' as bait for its V Cast Song ID service, making the song a free download to certain cellphones.\n",
      "On July 7 Prince introduced a perfume, 3121, by performing at Macy's in Minneapolis.\n",
      "In Britain he infuriated retailers by agreeing to have a newspaper, The Mail on Sunday, include the complete ''Planet Earth'' CD in copies on July 15.\n",
      "(The album is due for American release this Tuesday.\n",
      ") Presumably The Mail paid him something in the range of what he could have earned, much more slowly, through album sales.\n",
      "British fans have remunerated him in other ways.\n",
      "On Aug.\n",
      "1 he starts a string of no fewer than 21 sold-out arena concerts, 20,000 seats each, at the O2 (formerly the Millennium Dome) in London at the relatively low ticket price of $:31.21, about $64.\n",
      "The O2 ticket price also includes a copy of the album; Prince did the same thing with his tour for ''Musicology'' in 2004.\n",
      "Those ''Musicology'' albums were counted toward the pop charts, which then changed their rules; the ''Planet Earth'' albums will not be.\n",
      "But fans will have the record.\n",
      "Prince's priorities are obvious.\n",
      "The main one is getting his music to an audience, whether it's purchased or not.\n",
      "''Prince's only aim is to get music direct to those that want to hear it,'' his spokesman said when announcing that The Mail would include the CD.\n",
      "(After the newspaper giveaway was announced, Columbia Records' corporate parent, Sony Music, chose not to release ''Planet Earth'' for retail sale in Britain.\n",
      ") Other musicians may think that their best chance at a livelihood is locking away their music -- impossible as that is in the digital era -- and demanding that fans buy everything they want to hear.\n",
      "But Prince is confident that his listeners will support him,  if not through CD sales then at shows or through other deals.\n",
      "This is how most pop stars operate now: as brand-name corporations taking in revenue streams from publishing, touring, merchandising, advertising, ringtones, fashion, satellite radio gigs or whatever else their advisers can come up with.\n",
      "Rare indeed are holdouts like Bruce Springsteen who simply perform and record.\n",
      "The usual rationale is that hearing a U2 song in an iPod commercial or seeing Shakira's face on a cellphone billboard will get listeners interested in the albums that these artists release every few years after much painstaking effort.\n",
      "But Prince is different.\n",
      "His way of working has nothing to do with scarcity.\n",
      "In the studio -- he has his own recording complex, Paisley Park near Minneapolis  -- he is a torrent of new songs, while older, unreleased ones fill the archive he calls the Vault.\n",
      "Prince apparently has to hold himself back to release only one album a year.\n",
      "He's equally indefatigable in concert.\n",
      "On the road he regularly follows full-tilt shows -- singing, playing, dancing, sweating -- with jam sessions that stretch into the night.\n",
      "It doesn't hurt that at 49 he can still act like a sex symbol and that his stage shows are unpredictable.\n",
      "Through it all he still aims for hit singles.\n",
      "Although he has delved into all sorts of music, his favorite form is clearly the four-minute pop tune full of hooks.\n",
      "But his career choices don't revolve around squeezing the maximum return out of a few precious songs.\n",
      "They're about letting the music flow.\n",
      "Prince gravitated early to the Internet.\n",
      "Even in the days of dial-up he sought to make his music available online, first as a way of ordering albums and then through digital distribution.\n",
      "(He was also ahead of his time with another form of communication: text messaging abbreviations, having long ago traded ''you'' for ''U.''\n",
      ") Where the Internet truism is that information wants to be free, Prince's corollary is that music wants to be heard.\n",
      "How much he makes from his various efforts is a closely guarded secret.\n",
      "But he's not dependent on royalties trickling in from retail album sales after being filtered through major-label accounting procedures.\n",
      "Instead someone -- a sponsor, a newspaper, a promoter -- pays him upfront, making disc sales less important.\n",
      "Which is not to say that he's doing badly on that front: ''3121'' sold about 520,000 copies, according to Nielsen SoundScan, and ''Musicology,'' with its concert giveaways, was certified multiplatinum.\n",
      "Prince ended a two-decade contract with Warner Brothers Records in 1996 after a very public falling out with the label.\n",
      "During the mid-1990s he appeared with the word ''Slave'' painted on his face and said the label was holding back material he wanted to release.\n",
      "For a while he dropped the name Prince -- which was under contract to Warner Brothers and Warner/Chappell Music -- for an unpronounceable glyph; when the contracts ran out, he was Prince again.\n",
      "And since leaving Warner Brothers he has been independent.\n",
      "He owns his recordings himself, beginning with a three-CD set called ''Emancipation'' from 1996.\n",
      "He has released albums on his own NPG label and Web site or has licensed them, one by one, for distribution by major labels, presumably letting them compete for each title.\n",
      "Over the past decade he has had albums released through EMI, Arista, Universal and Sony.\n",
      "The idea behind long-term recording contracts is that a label will invest in building a career.\n",
      "But Prince (in part because of Warner Brothers' promotion) has been a full-fledged star since the '80s.\n",
      "So now a label's main job for him is to get the CDs into stores.\n",
      "Prince also experimented with having fans subscribe directly to receive his music online, which turned out to be a better idea in theory than in execution.\n",
      "After five years he quietly shut down his NPG Music Club in 2006.\n",
      "Still, his Web site (which is now 3121.com) usually has a rare recording or two for streaming or downloading.\n",
      "Why not?\n",
      "There's plenty more.\n",
      "''Planet Earth'' is a good but not great Prince album.\n",
      "Unlike ''3121,'' which built many of its tracks around zinging, programmed electronic sounds, ''Planet Earth'' sounds largely handmade, even retro.\n",
      "''In this digital age you could just page me,'' Prince sings in ''Somewhere Here on Earth,'' a slow-motion falsetto ballad.\n",
      "''I know it's the rage but it just don't engage me like a face-to-face.''\n",
      "Prince, as usual, is a one-man studio band -- drums, keyboards, guitars, vocals -- joined here and there by a horn section or a cooing female voice.\n",
      "This time he leans toward rock rather than funk.\n",
      "Serious songs begin and end the album.\n",
      "It starts with ''Planet Earth,'' an earnest environmental piano anthem with an orchestral buildup, and winds up with the devout ''Lion of Judah'' and with ''Resolution,'' an antiwar song.\n",
      "In between, Prince flirts a lot, playing hard-to-get as he rocks through ''Guitar'' (''I love you baby, but not like I love my guitar'') and promising sensual delights in the upbeat ''One U Wanna C'' and the slow-grinding ''Mr. Goodnight.''\n",
      "There's also a catchy, nutty song about a model, ''Chelsea Rodgers,'' who's both hard-partying and erudite; Prince sings that she knows about how ''Rome was chillin' in Carthage in 33 B.C.E.''  Although Columbia probably thinks otherwise, how the album fares commercially is almost incidental.\n",
      "With or without the CD business, Prince gets to keep making music: in arenas, in clubs, in the studio.\n",
      "Fans buy concert tickets, companies rent his panache, pleasure is shared.\n",
      "It's a party that can go on a long time.\n",

      "FROM where Frank Kind works, sidewalks look like gray chalk lines, billboards are the size of postcards and Central Park is a tidy mosaic of bonsai trees and bushes.\n",
      "When he is perched on a scaffold 45 floors above the cement sidewalk, Mr. Kind, 58, doesn't think about his brother-in-law Harry Heller, who fell from a scaffold and ended up with one leg shorter than the other.\n",
      "And he never looks down.\n",
      "\"I just pay attention,\" he said, \"to what I'm doing\".\n",
      "Mr. Kind has been a window washer for 43 years, since he was 15.\n",
      "When he started in the trade, he used a wooden chair suspended by rope from building rooftops or a cotton belt hooked around his waist and onto the outside of the building where he worked.\n",
      "In those days, scaffolds were little more than wooden planks powered by rope and muscle.\n",
      "Sometimes a belt would fray, a hook would pull free from masonry, a plank would tip.\n",
      "Window washers know the horror stories: four washers who fell from a scaffold at the Equitable Building in the 60's, another killed when his cotton belt tore in 1970, two others who died in 1990 when their scaffold plunged from the 12th floor of the Holiday Inn Crowne Plaza in Times Square.\n",
      "But today, nylon has replaced cotton, and hooks are bolted into window frames.\n",
      "New skyscrapers have customized wire scaffolds, powered by electricity and equipped with walkie-talkies and fire extinguishers.\n",
      "Everyone agrees that the window washer's job is safer.\n",
      "Still, working conditions are not for the weak of will or stomach.\n",
      "On Thursday, a fierce wind smashed a scaffold into a window of 919 Third Avenue, near 56th Street.\n",
      "A facade repairman crawled through the broken window onto the 22d floor, but another worker dangled from a safety rope 20 floors above the sidewalk until a lawyer in the building saved him.\n",
      "Other enemies of the window washer are wild birds that attack when their building-ledge nests are disturbed and windows that slam shut, leaving a washer dangling -- sometimes for hours -- with no way to climb back inside.\n",
      "And there is the occasional thrill seeker, be it nudist or parachutist.\n",
      "\"I was on the 110th floor of the Twin Towers when the guy jumped out with a parachute,\" Mr. Kind recalled as he and his partner, William Bubak, 61, took a break from the hundreds of windows they wash regularly at 888 Seventh Avenue, a 45-story office tower at 57th Street.\n",
      "\"He looked at me, I looked at him and he jumped out and pulled the cord.\n",
      "The Port Authority called me and asked why I didn't stop him.\n",
      "I said, 'I didn't have a parachute.\n",
      "' \"  Cesar Gerena still remembers the time he was washing windows at an apartment building on 58th Street.\n",
      "\"The guys inside say, 'Finally, we can see; it's that time again,' \" Mr. Gerena said.\n",
      "\"A lady walked past naked in the window right across from the ones I just washed.\n",
      "She did it every day at 8 A.M. That's New York\".\n",
      "Window washers in the city belong to Window Cleaners Local 2.\n",
      "Managers of large office and apartment buildings usually contract with maintenance companies, which get their workers from the union.\n",
      "The local president, Arnold Geller, said \"business was good\" until about 1985; then the recession brought commercial construction to a near-halt and forced companies to slash maintenance.\n",
      "Union membership plummeted.\n",
      "Today, Mr. Geller said, it is rebounding.\n",
      "\"Window cleaning,\" he explained, \"follows construction and the economy\".\n",
      "Most cleaners earn about $40,000 a year.\n",
      "Among the job's perks: bumping into someone famous, like a movie director who needs a window washer in his next film.\n",
      "\"I was working at 22 Broadway when Oliver Stone saw me in the lobby and says, 'Hey, how long you been doing this?\n",
      "' \" said Patrick DeFillippo, 45, of Glendale, Queens.\n",
      "\"I was with them all day taping 'Wall Street.\n",
      "' In that scene where Michael Douglas is arguing with Charlie Sheen, he goes to the window and waves at me.\n",
      "I got paid good for it, too\".\n",
      "The typical window cleaner's day begins between 5 and 6 A.M., before the sun starts its ascent, and ends before it scorches their skin and drenches their drab blue uniforms in perspiration.\n",
      "From their perches, they watch the city yawn its way into the working day.\n",
      "Their tales are told matter-of-factly; the daily monotony strengthens the gut.\n",
      "\"In 1969 was I working on the 19th floor, and a hook came out of the window,\" Mr. Bubak recalled.\n",
      "\"I swung off the window, hit my head against the building and was out cold.\n",
      "I gave it up for seven years\".\n",
      "But, he said, the pay brought him back.\n",
      "\"Sometimes I still get butterflies if I haven't been on the scaffold for a while, but it goes away\".\n",
      "Mr. Kind started washing windows with his father, Jacob, in 1952.\n",
      "His sons, Jason and Steve, have followed him into the union.\n",
      "A 14-karat squeegee hanging from a gold rope chain around his neck has three diamonds -- one for each generation of window cleaners in his family.\n",
      "\"It's quiet up here,\" said Jason Kind, 21, looking toward New Jersey from the roof of 888 Seventh Avenue.\n",
      "\"All you hear is the wind and the air-conditioner motors.\n",
      "You get a rush; it's like bungee jumping\".\n",

      "\"It was a great win, especially to have Ruben in the middle of it,\" said David Cone who, like Sierra, was 11th-hour pennant insurance picked up by the Yankees before the inter-league trading deadline Monday night.\n",
      "Cone, unlike Sierra, had already made his presence felt in a big way, winning his first start as a Yankee last weekend, then benefiting from last night's rally to improve to 2-0 with New York and 11-6 over all.\n",
      "As for Sierra, he had only two hits in his first four games as a Yankee -- both singles.\n",
      "\"He had been pressing a little bit,\" Yankees Manager Buck Showalter said with obvious understatement.\n",
      "\"You get a little antsy to do something, and sometimes it's hard,\" Sierra admitted.\n",
      "\"I was too anxious\".\n",
      "Cone, the former Mets pitcher who is intimately familiar with the fickle nature of New York, knew Sierra had to create something, and soon.\n",
      "The Yankees fans had received Sierra warmly all week, understandable since he had been traded for the vastly unpopular Danny Tartabull.\n",
      "But Cone was well aware that love would be fleeting if the designated hitter didn't start producing hits.\n",
      "\"I did notice the chant for Darryl,\" Cone said with a knowing smile.\n",

      "And when he did, no group breathed a louder collective sigh of relief than the Yankees.\n",
      "\"You could just see the look on Ruben's face when he got the hit -- finally he made a contribution to win a game,\" said Cone.\n",
      "\"That's the type of thing that can get this team on a roll, get him on a roll\".\n",
      "The ovation and chant certainly put a smile on Sierra's face.\n",
      "\"It gave me goose pimples,\" he admitted.\n",
      "The Sierra hit, like manna from heaven for the Yankees, caused the Stadium to erupt with the first positive ovations not reserved exclusively for a Don Mattingly, Paul O'Neill or Wade Boggs in a long time.\n",
      "How needed was that inning and that hit?\n",
      "Well, the Yankees had come perilously close to wasting a rare commodity: a strong eight-inning pitching performance from a starter.\n",
      "Cone, making his first start in the Stadium, allowed only three runs on five hits.\n",
      "That was almost not good enough as the Yankees spent most of the game raising eyebrows and questions about with their continuing lack of offense.\n",
      "Only the night before, the club has managed just two runs on seven hits in a 5-2 loss.\n",
      "By the time the \"Dar-ryl!\n",

      "Even with last night's victory, the Yankees can only point to one game in their last six in which they posted double figures in hits.\n",
      "They scored four runs or less in three of those six games.\n",
      "The eighth-inning rally spared another question and answer period about why the Yankees can't hit all of a sudden.\n",
      "Bones ignited the Yankees comeback by allowing two singles, to Mike Stanley and Tony Fernandez.\n",
      "The Brewers' relievers then supplied the gasoline, especially Ron Rightnowar, who gave up a sacrifice fly to Gerald Williams and a two-out run scoring single to O'Neill before facing Sierra.\n",
      "With one swing, Sierra drove his r.b.i. total to four in five games with the Yankees.\n",

      "With the activities and far-right views of paramilitary groups a growing concern for many law-enforcement agencies around the country, a Senate subcommittee today heard from five leaders of the self-styled \"militias\" who maintained that they were nothing more than ordinary people who loved the Constitution, feared Government abuse and owned guns only to protect themselves.\n",
      "But during their 90-minute appearance before the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Terrorism, Technology and Government Information, in which the exchanges sometimes grew testy, the witnesses also provided glimpses of the kind of views that contribute to perceptions of their being outside the political mainstream.\n",
      "Among the views expressed by the militant leaders were that the Government was out of control, that Japan might have been involved in the Oklahoma City bombing last April 19 and that at least two bombs destroyed the Federal Building, that an armed civil conflict was approaching and that the Government was using \"weather-control techniques so the new world order could starve millions of Americans\".\n",

      "The militant leaders' words were in sharp contrast with testimony earlier in the day from five law-enforcement officials who depicted the paramilitary groups as disturbing and dangerous.\n",
      "Urging the group leaders to reveal as much about themselves and their organizations as possible, Mr. Specter said at one point in an exchange with Mr. Olson: \"I want to hear all your ideas.\n",
      "Then we'll let the American public judge whether you are right or I am right\".\n",

      "One militant who did not testify, Mark Koernke, a leader of a Michigan paramilitary group who is better known by his radio-show name, Mark from Michigan, said, \"We needed another two hours to let Senators ask more questions, but as far as it went, I think they did real well\".\n",

      "But in earlier testimony, the law-enforcement officers and two Democratic Senators, Max Baucus of Montana and Carl Levin of Michigan, painted a more troublesome picture of paramilitary groups.\n",
      "While careful to avoid accusing any of today's witnesses of illegal activity, they told of killings, shootings, threats and conspiracies involving members of the organizations or people from other right-wing groups, like the Ku Klux Klan.\n",
      "James L. Brown, a senior official with the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms, said his agency estimated that there were paramilitary groups in as many as 40 states.\n",
      "While Mr. Specter declared himself satisfied that the group leaders who testified would \"turn off\" most Americans, the hearing was belittled as a \"soapbox for the wacky right\" by Representative Charles E. Schumer, Democrat of Brooklyn, who criticized the subcommittee for not balancing the testimony with appearances by people who say they have been intimidated by the groups.\n",

      "In 1947, Judge Reilly helped the Senate Labor Committee draft the Taft-Hartley Act, the landmark labor legislation that among other things barred union-employer contracts that required all workers to be union members.\n",
      "He was in private practice in Washington from 1946 until 1970, when President Richard M. Nixon named him an Associate Judge on the newly organized Court of Appeals, which serves as the highest court in the District's municipal court system.\n",
      "He was named Chief Judge in 1972.\n",
      "On the court, Judge Reilly was admired for his \"highly literate and beautifully written opinions,\" Judge Kern said, attributing his refined writing style to his classical education at the Boston Latin School and Harvard.\n",

      "Since the loft conversion boom began in the 1970's, landlords have called loft tenants \"sleazy,\" \"animals\" and a lot of other names.\n",
      "At the same time, these landlords were happy and eager to rent undesirable, empty space to artists willing to renovate and improve their property into desirable studios and homes.\n",
      "But some things have changed.\n",
      "You state that 250 of the 820 loft buildings registered with the New York City Loft Board have been fully legalized and have received residential certificates of occupancy.\n",
      "But in addition, according to the board's most recent statistics, 18 buildings have temporary certificates of occupancy, the final step before full residential legalization; 237 have permits to do the necessary work; 68 are ready to apply for permits, and 218 have started the legalization process.\n",
      "It hasn't been as swift as the State Legislature contemplated in 1982, but the Loft Law is working.\n",
      "The buildings are being brought up to minimum residential safety standards, and the cost of the work and legalization is passed on to tenants.\n",
      "Some of the credit for progress has to go to the Loft Board, under the direction of the Mayor's Office and Deputy Mayor Fran Reiter, and to the law's 1992 renewal, which included additional incentives for landlords to finish a process they were supposed to complete years ago.\n",
      "That leaves only about 30 buildings whose owners refuse to obey the law and bring the plumbing, electric and fire safety systems up to code.\n",
      "In the case of the two Brooklyn buildings you mention, the owners have filed hardship applications at the Loft Board seeking to exempt their buildings from legalization.\n",
      "Tenants who are covered under the Loft Law live in these buildings legally -- it is the recalcitrant landlords who, in refusing to bring their buildings up to minimum safety standards, are in violation of the law.\n",

      "-- Not long ago, the oldest synagogue in this college town underwent a $1 million restoration.\n",
      "The building, to the relief of many, was salvaged from disrepair and possible demolition.\n",
      "But in the process, its character was markedly changed.\n",
      "Today, atop rows of red brick, the interlocking triangles of the Star of David sit alongside the interlacing ovals of the Toyota logo.\n",
      "At the delicately refurbished bimah, where the Torah was read aloud to congregants for close to a century, clerks in uniform operate a busy cash register.\n",
      "The synagogue's stained-glass windows and old chandelier, repaired to glistening condition, splash light upon racks of T-shirts and tables full of knickknacks like shot glasses and foam bear claws.\n",
      "Inside one doorway, the words of Exodus 25:8 curl in illuminated script across a cream-hued wall.\n",
      "''Make for me a sanctuary,'' the verse reads, ''and I will dwell in their midst.''\n",
      "Outside, a sign above the entrance denotes what this 114-year-old sanctuary has been renamed: the Cubs Den.\n",
      "In the summer of 2012, the Sons of Israel synagogue, which had not housed a congregation since 1991, was repurposed as a souvenir store for the minor league baseball team next door.\n",
      "Before this season, the club ended a 17-year affiliation with the Arizona Diamondbacks and became the Class A team of the Chicago Cubs -- hence the shop's name and the bear claws inside.\n",
      "The synagogue sits just beyond the left-field wall at Four Winds Field and may occupy a singular place in the already colorful landscape of professional sports.\n",
      "Tzvi Novick, a professor of Jewish thought and culture at nearby Notre Dame, described the building, with some wonderment, as a ''complex mixture of homage, kitsch, and commercialism.''\n",
      "It is simply, he said, ''a very interesting cultural object.''\n",
      "It became that way, apparently, through a conflation of efforts and aspirations: those of a Jewish community trying to preserve a presence in an area where it once thrived; those of a city hoping to revitalize a flagging neighborhood; those of a savvy businessman resuscitating a floundering team.\n",
      "It has at once reflected a demographic shift in the region and highlighted the complicated tensions in the growing field of historic preservation.\n",
      "It has left scores of people in the community ecstatic, irked, amused or some combination thereof.\n",
      "Andrew Berlin, 54, who bought the team on Nov.\n",
      "11, 2011 -- finalizing the deal, for numerological reasons, at 11:11 a.m. -- split the cost of renovating the synagogue with the city while signing a 20-year lease on the ballpark.\n",
      "Berlin, the chairman of a Chicago packaging company, describes himself as a ''twice-a-year Jew.''\n",
      "The idea to display the Old Testament verse was his.\n",
      "He had encountered the words somewhere and thought of his stadium.\n",
      "''I thought of making a sanctuary for everyone, not just Jews,'' said Berlin, who is also a minority owner of the Chicago Cubs.\n",
      "''Baseball for me is more than the game.''\n",
      "Berlin has applied that philosophy to his team, which suffered from low attendance under its previous owner, Joe Kernan, a former Indiana governor.\n",
      "The ballpark's ethos now seems closer to Walt Disney World than Yankee Stadium.\n",
      "Berlin has focused on details, including having the team's mascot sprayed with cotton candy cologne before every game.\n",
      "Improvements have totaled $10 million, according to the club president, Joe Hart, and this season the team will easily set a franchise attendance record.\n",
      "Merchandise sales, Berlin said, have gone up 850 percent since he bought the team.\n",
      "''It was an O.K. ballpark to come see a game before, but now, especially for families, there's just so much more, and it's a lot nicer,'' said Glenn Kozora, who sat for a recent game in the new Buffalo Wild Wings home run porch in left field.\n",
      "To his left was the new Miller Lite Tiki Hut.\n",
      "To his right was the new Budweiser Picnic Garden.\n",
      "Directly behind was the new team store.\n",
      "Inside, sports souvenirs sat arrayed in an atmosphere of vague religiosity.\n",
      "Behind the cash register, between the white and gold columns restored from the original synagogue, there was a parody reproduction of Michelangelo's ''Creation of Adam,'' with God, in this version, reaching out with a baseball glove and the words ''Play ball'' written in gothic type.\n",
      "Carrying a bag of souvenirs for his two children, Rob Rohena, of Nappanee, Ind.\n",
      ", guessed that geographic context might affect how the synagogue was perceived.\n",
      "''Where I was born, maybe they would have seen it as sacrilegious,'' said Rohena, who was raised around Hasidic Jews in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn.\n",
      "''But here -- I don't know -- it's nice to see them make use of the building.''\n",
      "Berlin laughed aside the notion that some might find the décor distasteful, noting it was meant to be kitschy.\n",
      "''Everybody knows that Eve stole first and Adam stole second,'' he said, ''so baseball is all throughout the Old Testament.''\n",
      "Still, Berlin acknowledged there was a line.\n",
      "Early on, he proposed putting a target on the roof of the synagogue, and if any batter struck it with a home run ball, he would give away a car.\n",
      "But the rabbis and Jewish community members advising Berlin told him the plan was in poor taste, and the Toyota banner went up instead.\n",
      "Bob Jaeger, president of Partners for Sacred Places, a nonprofit organization focused on the conversion of historic religious buildings, said such tensions and discussions were becoming increasingly common.\n",
      "In an ideal situation, he said, a converted place of worship respects its old identity, maintains its visual character and continues to contribute to the community.\n",
      "''I think these are healthy debates because more and more sacred places are changing hands,'' Jaeger said.\n",
      "''As a public, we should pay attention.''\n",
      "Many current and former members of the community were relieved to see the building restored.\n",
      "For others, the feeling has been closer to resignation, something short of satisfaction.\n",
      "Robert Nevel, 61, an architect in Chicago, grew up attending the synagogue.\n",
      "He became emotional last week recounting his bar mitzvah at the checkout counter.\n",
      "Nevel said that the overt commercialism and kitsch inside his old synagogue made him uneasy, and that as an architect he also felt let down.\n",
      "He rued, for instance, that the original stone base, a distinguishing feature of early Chicago architecture, had been ''mucked up'' with the installation of a concrete accessibility ramp.\n",
      "And he said positioning the cash register in the holiest area of the synagogue felt like accidental symbolism.\n",
      "''If this had been done by Rem Koolhaas,'' Nevel said, referring to the provocative Dutch architect, ''I would think it was a sardonic commentary to what we pray to, the high priest of commerce.\n",
      "But I think this would be giving them too much credit.''\n",
      "And still, Nevel echoed several who invoked the Hebrew law that discourages waste, bal tashchit.\n",
      "The synagogue, they said, is clean, serving a purpose and, most important, still upright.\n",
      "That means a lot.\n",
      "The synagogue housed an Orthodox congregation from 1901, when it opened amid a bustling Jewish community downtown, until the 1980s, when it briefly became Reconstructionist.\n",
      "In 1991, with almost no members, the building was donated to Indiana Landmarks, a private historic preservation foundation.\n",
      "In 2005, the foundation sold the synagogue to Chris Wood, a sound and light technician who briefly used it as a private home.\n",
      "In 2007, the city bought it for $130,000.\n",
      "Various plans were discussed, but none stuck.\n",
      "The Jewish Federation of St. Joseph Valley wanted to move the synagogue to its campus, also in South Bend, across the St. Joseph River.\n",
      "The History Museum of South Bend considered making it a nondenominational museum of religion.\n",
      "City planners had already discussed using it as a stadium gift shop years before Berlin bought the team.\n",
      "Judy Shroyer, president of nearby Temple Beth-El and a lifetime resident of South Bend, said it was good that thousands of people would walk through a historical synagogue in a region where many referred to them as ''Jewish churches.''\n",
      "But she said she and her neighbors still sometimes felt compunction.\n",
      "''There's been a huge amount of discussion and a lot of wringing of hands: 'Isn't it terrible what's happened to our little shul?\n",
      "' '' Shroyer said.\n",
      "David Piser, 75, the final caretaker of the synagogue before it closed, said he had now grown tired of the criticism.\n",
      "He listens to detractors and then asks them, ''Where were you when we needed you?''\n",

      "Ernest Hemingway was a maker of lists and a collector of his life's ephemera.\n",
      "For the first time, some of the objects that this American writer gathered during his long career -- bullfighting stubs from Pamplona in Spain, boastful fishing logs from expeditions off the Cuban coast, coy letters to a mistress, penciled drafts of stories -- will be on display in an exhibition at the Morgan Library & Museum from Sept.\n",
      "25 through Jan.\n",
      "31.\n",
      "The show, ''Ernest Hemingway: Between Two Wars,'' has six sections, based loosely on places Hemingway lived.\n",
      "The first touches on his years growing up in Oak Park, Ill.\n",
      ", and working as a cub reporter at The Kansas City Star.\n",
      "It goes on to include Hemingway's time in Italy during World War I; in Paris; in Key West, Fla.\n",
      "; in Cuba; and in France and Germany during World War II.\n",
      "After that, said Declan Kiely, the Morgan's curator of literary and historical manuscripts, ''he gets out 'The Old Man and the Sea' in 1952, but from that period onward he is writing a lot but not finishing anything.''\n",
      "Treasures include Hemingway's World War II dog tags and a creased press accreditation card from a time when the writer was living in the Ritz in Paris and covering, among other things, the Battle of Hürtgen Forest, one of the war's bloodiest battles, for Collier's magazine.\n",
      "The Morgan's show features about 95 objects, with roughly 25 from the Morgan's collection.\n",
      "One recent afternoon, in the fourth-floor conservation center, Mr. Kiely wheeled some of the objects out on a cart and unpacked them carefully from cardboard boxes onto a table.\n",
      "He has steadily acquired Hemingway material since he began developing the idea for the show in 2012, including a four-page letter he bought at Sotheby's auction house last year written by Hemingway on July 31, 1944, to the woman who would become his fourth wife, Mary Welsh.\n",
      "''It's a little coy,'' Mr. Kiely said.\n",
      "''There's a cringe-making reference to an orgasm being like a grenade when the pin is pulled out.''\n",
      "Most items in the exhibition come from the John F. Kennedy Presidential Library and Museum in Boston, which is teaming up with the Morgan on the show.\n",
      "Ms. Welsh, a friend of Jacqueline Kennedy, donated much Hemingway material to the presidential library and museum after Hemingway's death, Mr. Kiely said.\n",
      "(The exhibition will travel to Boston after it closes in New York.\n",
      ")  Why stage a Hemingway exhibition now?\n",
      "''The simple answer is that it's never been done,'' Mr. Kiely said.\n",
      "''There's never been a full-scale Hemingway exhibition.\n",
      "Ninety-nine percent of these things are being seen for the first time.''\n",
      "There are drafts of early stories Hemingway wrote in pencil on American Red Cross hospital stationery in Italy, where he was a volunteer, or on Parisian telegram sheets.\n",
      "''What I am trying to do is show the way in which he works and works and rewrites,'' Mr. Kiely said.\n",
      "''The craft is all here in the manuscripts.''\n",
      "There are lists of titles Hemingway tried out before settling on ''A Farewell to Arms'' (''The Italian Experience'' was one), or the 1924 short story ''Indian Camp'' (''One Night Last Summer,'' for example).\n",
      "The show includes letters from Gertrude Stein, Dorothy Parker, J. D. Salinger and a 10-page letter from F. Scott Fitzgerald to Hemingway in Paris around 1929, critiquing a draft of ''A Farewell to Arms.''\n",
      "Fitzgerald had helped the young Hemingway, and the two had been friends.\n",
      "But by now Hemingway's literary star was rising fast.\n",
      "At the bottom of the letter, Hemingway simply notes, ''Kiss my ass.\n",
      "EH''  ''Hemingway was a pack rat,'' Mr. Kiely said, chuckling as he folded the letter.\n",
      "''He never threw things away.''\n",
      "GRAHAM BOWLEY  TIMES SQUARE 'ERWARTUNG'  The heart of Times Square after dark probably isn't the most genial setting for Schoenberg and the mournful atonality of ''Erwartung,'' or ''Expectation,'' his 1909 monologue for a solo soprano, and a pillar of musical modernism.\n",
      "But the South African artist Robin Rhode, who will stage the work there in the fall as part of the 10th anniversary of Performa, the performance-art biennial, said that when he heard Times Square was a possibility for a piece based on the Schoenberg work, he leapt at it.\n",
      "''I love the idea of bringing to life a trained and informed structure and having that play itself out in a very public way to a mostly unexpecting audience,'' said Mr. Rhode, whose commission to create the piece was just announced, along with the commissions of several other prominent artists, for ''Performa 15,'' which will take place across the city Nov.\n",
      "1 through Nov.\n",
      "22.\n",
      "''Erwartung'' presents a lone woman, wandering in a moonlit forest, pining for a lost love.\n",
      "Mr. Rhode, 39, who often presents performances in public spaces that are based on drawings or sculpture, said he saw the narrative as a metaphor for black women in apartheid-era South Africa ''waiting for men who had to leave for long periods to go work in mines, essentially in exile, or men held by the police, with no date of return.''\n",
      "''I saw the skyscrapers as the forest and the billboards as the moonlight,'' he said.\n",
      "''I imagined the soprano being lost in this kind of mass audience.''\n",
      "Of the work, which will take place in a domesticlike stage setting marked off by doors used in low-income South African homes, Mr. Rhode added, ''The risk factor of doing something like this in Times Square is immense, to put it lightly.''\n",
      "Performa's 2015 commissions will also include the artists Jesper Just, Francesco Vezzoli (in collaboration with the ballet dancer David Hallberg), Pauline Curnier Jardin and the choreographer Jérôme Bel, who will stage performances by an ensemble composed of both trained and untrained dancers.\n",
      "The commissions, which will include more artists to be named later, are being planned to coalesce around a loose focus of this year's biennial on performance art's deep historical roots, reaching at least to the Renaissance and spectacles like Leonardo's machine-driven ''Feast of Paradise'' for the Sforza court in Milan in 1490.\n",
      "''Robin has a wonderful mix of classical art history and on-the-street ideas, and I found that a really interesting combination in the context of what we're trying to do this year,'' said RoseLee Goldberg, Performa's founder, who added that she hoped the biennial -- which has presented 592 performances, worked with 732 artists and played to more than 200,000 viewers over its first decade -- would be seen as having ''truly legitimized performance in the academic and museum world and beyond.''\n",
      "''When we started, there were people who would wriggle their noses and say, 'That's weird,' '' Ms. Goldberg said, ''and I think what we've done is changed a lot of minds.''\n",
      "RANDY KENNEDY  DUO CREATES 'DIVA'S SONG'  When a couple lives in, around and through art, what happens when the life of one of the partners is threatened?\n",
      "For the painter Jerry Kearns and the performer Nora York, who met in the art world and have been married since 1998, the answer was obvious: Put their heads together like Mickey and Judy and do a show.\n",
      "When Ms. York, who has performed for decades at the Knitting Factory and the Public Theater, found out in May that she had cancer, she and Mr. Kearns, whose comics-inflected work often carries a real-world political weight, decided to transform an exhibition he was planning at the Mike Weiss Gallery in Chelsea into a forum about mortality, art and will.\n",
      "Based on Puccini's ''Tosca,'' the show, ''Diva's Song,'' which opens on Thursday, uses acrylic wall paintings of a larger-than-life-size femme fatale, Diva, and her gun-toting cowboy boyfriend, Sugar, to tell a noir-meets-O.K.-Corral story of a showdown with the Devil.\n",
      "''Unlike Puccini's 'Tosca,' '' an essay on the gallery's website explains, ''the exhibition's narrative outcome is ultimately uncertain.''\n",
      "''Definitely, however,'' it adds, ''the knife-wielding diva, in a stance reminiscent of Judith with the head of Holofernes, is the one in control.''\n",
      "In an interview, Ms. York -- who interpreted the ''Vissi d'arte'' aria from ''Tosca'' in a show at the Public Theater in 2011 -- described her illness as ''this dilemma we have in our personal lives.''\n",
      "But she and Mr. Kearns said they wanted the show to be less about personal crisis than about art's existential power.\n",
      "''How do you confront this without making a one-woman show about illness, which I had absolutely no desire to do?''\n",
      "she said.\n",
      "(A website set up for the show, divas-song.com, puts the exhibition's images together with a recording of Ms. York and others interpreting the ''Tosca'' aria; Ms. York will also give a performance for the show at Joe's Pub at the Public Theater on July 29.\n",
      ")  Mr. Kearns said the hope was that the collaboration -- whose images he and several former students have been creating directly on the gallery walls, to be painted over when the show ends on Aug.\n",
      "22 -- was something that ''gets at notions of what art is actually for.''\n",
      "''At the heart of the work both of us do is storytelling,'' he added.\n",
      "''This is about the question, 'What do you do when you seem to stop passing through life and it turns around and comes at you like a runaway train?\n",

      "The graying of America is being reflected on screen, though perhaps not in ways that threaten the established order.\n",
      "The makers of ''Avengers: Age of Ultron'' will not be losing sleep over the recent ''5 Flights Up,'' starring Morgan Freeman and Diane Keaton, or the Swedish import ''The 100-Year-Old Man Who Climbed Out the Window and Disappeared'' or even ''Danny Collins,'' about an aging rocker played by Al Pacino, even though it was Mr. Pacino's most successful lead role at the box office in a while.\n",
      "But even in the Marvel movie universe, tectonic plates are shifting: The audience for the first ''Avengers'' movie was evenly split between the crucial under-25 demographic and older moviegoers, while 59 percent of the ''Ultron'' crowd has been over 25.\n",
      "This may have to do with theatrical movies losing their grip on young men, but either way ''that's a huge shift,'' said Tom Brueggemann, a movie-exhibition veteran and former film buyer who writes for the blog Thompson on Hollywood.\n",
      "''Though it's still less a risk for a studio executive to O.K. one $150 million picture than three $40 million pictures,'' when the lower-priced films are aimed at a narrower, more mature audience.\n",
      "At the same time, the way that American cinema particularly has treated older people is changing.\n",
      "Last year, Bill Murray played a reprobate senior in ''St. Vincent,'' John Lithgow and Alfred Molina starred as an aging gay married couple in ''Love Is Strange,'' and ''Land Ho!''\n",
      "involved 60-ish former brothers-in-law trying to reclaim their youth.\n",
      "If Michael Keaton 63, had won at the Oscars this year, he would have been the second oldest best actor ever (after Henry Fonda), in a movie (''Birdman'') about age, regret and renewal.\n",
      "The highly profitable ''Expendables'' series celebrates aging action stars, largely for having the resilience just to show up.\n",
      "But it's in the independent, foreign and specialized realm of cinema where the boomer generation is having its impact.\n",
      "''The older generation is really a core audience for independent film,'' said Michael Barker, co-president of Sony Pictures Classics, which in August will release ''Grandma.''\n",
      "starring Lily Tomlin, and last year had ''Love Is Strange'' and ''Land Ho!''\n",
      "''They're the audience you can depend on time and time again.''\n",
      "When his company put out the Oscar-winning ''Amour'' in 2012, ''there were all these naysayers claiming the older audience would not relate to it.\n",
      "And they embraced it the most.''\n",
      "''I think there are a couple of things happening,'' Mr. Barker continued.\n",
      "''One: Older audiences are going to the movies.\n",
      "Two: Older audiences embrace stories about what they're going through.\n",
      "I think younger audiences are afraid of that.''\n",
      "In ''Grandma,'' Ms. Tomlin plays an Adrienne Rich-inspired poet who has a pregnant granddaughter and a bad attitude toward the new world.\n",
      "''The Farewell Party,'' opening May 22, is a dark Israeli comedy about retirees-cum-Kevorkians.\n",
      "And then there's ''Hello, My Name Is Doris,'' scheduled for 2016, in which Sally Field will play a reclusive older woman whose eccentricities make her hip.\n",
      "''It wasn't like we said, 'We have to jump on this train,' '' said the ''Doris'' director and co-writer Michael Showalter.\n",
      "''We just had a character we were writing about who happened to be a woman of a certain age.\n",
      "If anything we were like, 'Gee, this movie will have a hard time getting made.\n",
      "' We're not savvy enough to aim at any demographic.''\n",
      "But the demographic has made itself felt, notably via the British import ''The Best Exotic Marigold Hotel'' (2012), which made a remarkable $46 million domestically, twice that much internationally, and cost only about $10 million, according to the website Box Office Mojo.\n",
      "Its success was not entirely surprising: Judi Dench is an ever-popular quantity, Maggie Smith and Penelope Wilton were fan favorites from ''Downton Abbey,'' and the film was released abroad first, allowing it to arrive here an established hit.\n",
      "And there was a secondary romantic story line -- a kind of insurance -- involving younger people.\n",
      "Now the condition of being a mature adult is being more warmly embraced.\n",
      "In the current ''I'll See You in My Dreams,'' which made an impact this year at the usually youth-obsessed Sundance Film Festival, Blythe Danner stars as a retired schoolteacher who plays golf and bridge and suddenly has to contend with the attentions of her much younger pool boy (Martin Starr) and a dashing contemporary (Sam Elliott).\n",
      "It's a feel-good film on the surface, but it's also about the approach of death and the shelf life of love.\n",
      "''Grandma,'' as the name implies, defines its title character by her age, and Ms. Tomlin makes her as resentful of fate as she could possibly be.\n",
      "Which doesn't mean she won't strike a chord with audiences.\n",
      "It's not as if mature characters haven't always been in the movies, but the problems of being old have seldom been embraced as warmly as they are now.\n",
      "The boomer generation is at the point where it has to understand that ''you're going to fade, fall apart, lose your beauty and come face to face with mortality,'' said Thom Gencarelli, 55, chairman of the communications department at Manhattan College and the editor, with Brian Cogan, of ''Baby Boomers and Popular Culture.''\n",
      "Still, he said, ''when people are past the passion of adolescence and young adulthood and some Hollywood-ized version of life, I don't think they're interested in something that doesn't talk to the realities.\n",
      "And who's producing these movies?\n",
      "Sure, they're doing so with a lot of strategists and committees, but where are the ideas coming from to begin with?\n",

      "In a city crowded with venerable towers and gleaming new skyscrapers, builders and developers are trying to squeeze more money out of their real estate by taking advantage of one of their last available spaces: their rooftops.\n",
      "Cocktail lounges and restaurants have popped up on the tops of hotels, office towers and residential buildings, offering views of the city's skyline, its bridges and waterfront, as well as $20 mixed drinks.\n",
      "Even higher are observatories in the tallest skyscrapers, which are tapping into the city's soaring tourism market.\n",
      "The city's highest perch officially opened on Friday, when five elevators started whisking visitors 1,268 feet up to the 102nd floor of 1 World Trade Center -- in 48 seconds -- for ''helicopter views'' of Manhattan and beyond.\n",
      "This comes as no surprise to the current generation of high-altitude revelers.\n",
      "While the appetite for rooftop play areas remains voracious, real estate experts say the same is not true for the highest of spots: When it comes to observatories, they say, the city may be nearing a view glut.\n",
      "''You could end up with too many observatories and not enough people,'' said Joseph Reagan, a senior real estate analyst.\n",
      "Just take a look.\n",
      "The new trade center observatory will compete for visitors with two heavily trafficked viewing sites: Top of the Rock, at 30 Rockefeller Plaza, and the Empire State Building, the gold standard of observation decks with 4.3 million visitors last year.\n",
      "And more are on the way.\n",
      "On the Far West Side of Manhattan, one developer has designed a two-story, outdoor observation deck-bar-restaurant that will be cantilevered over the Time Warner Building, 1,100 feet above Hudson Yards, at 33rd Street and 10th Avenue.\n",
      "Next to Grand Central Terminal on East 42nd Street, another developer has planned an observatory at the top of One Vanderbilt, a proposed 63-story office tower.\n",
      "Underscoring how popular the sky-high trend has become, Zagat, the restaurant guide, recently issued its list of the ''10 Hot Rooftop Scenes in NYC.''\n",
      "''It's the view,'' said Alison Calegari, a digital marketing specialist, as she sipped a glass of wine on a recent weekday at the Skylark, a cocktail lounge on the roof of an otherwise nondescript building on West 39th Street in the Fashion District.\n",
      "''It's summertime.\n",
      "I want to see the light, not darkness.\n",
      "One World Trade Center is more touristy; this is more authentic.''\n",
      "To get to the Skylark, Ms. Calegari entered a barely noticeable door on a side street, rode up 30 stories in a freight elevator and climbed two flights of narrow stairs, as if entering a speakeasy.\n",
      "There she found an outdoor deck with a six-foot glass wall that puts patrons practically face to face with the surrounding buildings.\n",
      "Nearby, in Times Square, the Knickerbocker Hotel is opening a rooftop space that will feature dishes from the celebrity chef Charlie Palmer as well as a cigar lounge.\n",
      "In Lower Manhattan, a developer is reopening a boutique-size, glass-enclosed observatory at the top of a 66-story tower at 70 Pine Street as part of a four-story restaurant and bar.\n",
      "Still, heights are not for everybody.\n",
      "Only a fraction -- 13 percent -- of the 56.4 million tourists who poured into New York City last year visited the top of the Empire State Building or the Top of the Rock.\n",
      "And the strengthening dollar could put a crimp in foreign tourism, the bread and butter of observatories.\n",
      "''There will certainly be some growing pains in the next year or two as the market goes from two to three observatories, especially since the novelty factor of 1 World Trade Center is likely to attract a lot of visitors initially,'' said Mr. Reagan, who works for Green Street Advisors, a real estate research firm.\n",
      "One developer, Gary Barnett, has already scrapped plans to put an observatory atop the slender 1,775-foot tall Nordstrom Tower he is building on West 57th Street, saying he would rather sell condominiums than sacrifice valuable square footage.\n",
      "''You need express elevators, staircases,'' Mr. Barnett said.\n",
      "''It costs you square footage on every floor.''\n",
      "The renewed interest in observation decks has been spurred in large part by the enormous success of the Empire State Building, which has an outdoor deck on the 86th floor and an indoor deck on the 102nd floor.\n",
      "The number of visitors at the Empire State, one of the most recognizable buildings in the world, has risen year after year, with annual revenues more than doubling to $111.5 million last year, from $40 million in 2004.\n",
      "The deck, whose profit last year was $82.5 million, now accounts for 40 percent of the building's entire revenue.\n",
      "Despite the appeal, the use of rooftops for dining, drinking and entertainment is not a new development.\n",
      "Before air-conditioning, rooftops made public assembly possible in the middle of the summer.\n",
      "The Astor Hotel, which opened in Times Square in 1904, had a vast rooftop garden with pergolas, tempiettos, triumphal arches, fountains, arcades and a bandshell.\n",
      "Over time, however, they fell out of favor and the roofs of hotels and office buildings were more likely to be packed with air-conditioners, fans and power generators.\n",
      "But now even rooftops of small buildings -- at least by New York City standards -- have become fashionable gathering spots.\n",
      "One of the first, which opened several years ago, was a lavish outdoor garden and indoor bar on the rooftop of the 20-story office building at 230 Fifth Avenue.\n",
      "It once boasted a $1,200 margarita, the Frozen Fifth Avenue, a mixture of expensive spirits served in a specially designed glass.\n",
      "Today, there are chic rooftop scenes at the Gansevoort, the citizenM and the Jane hotels, among many others.\n",
      "At 75 Rockefeller Plaza, RXR Realty is adding multiple outdoor decks to the 33-story office building, not to attract paying customers but to lure new tenants.\n",
      "''It has nothing to do with height, although views make them more special,'' said Richard J. DeMarco, a partner at the design firm Montroy Andersen DeMarco, which worked on the World Trade Center observatory as well as a roof deck at 160 Fifth Avenue, a 10-story office building.\n",
      "''A rooftop space puts a commercial building on the map.''\n",
      "Adam Rose, a developer, is converting 70 Pine Street, an Art Deco building near the New York Stock Exchange, into what promise to be the most expensive rental apartments in Lower Manhattan, with a restaurant and bars on floors 62, 63, 64 and 66 to be managed by the team behind the Spotted Pig, the celebrated West Village restaurant.\n",
      "He is restoring the observatory, where diners will have unobstructed views and the ability to walk out onto the narrow terraces.\n",
      "Mr. Rose is spending $5 million to create an amenity for tenants and a downtown nightspot.\n",
      "''This is a major element of making 70 Pine Street special,'' Mr. Rose said.\n",
      "''It adds value to everything below it.''\n",
      "Mr. Rose's project is not designed to compete with the big observatories and will never attract millions of tourists.\n",
      "But like Top of the Rock, the outdoor terraces on the 66th floor of 70 Pine will offer visitors a sense of being among the city's skyscrapers, rather than looking down on other buildings from the clouds.\n",
      "For now, 1 World Trade Center has all the latest technology, a steak house and panoramic views of New York City, the harbor, Long Island, Bear Mountain and western New Jersey.\n",
      "Legends, the company that runs the observatory, spent nearly $80 million, according to executives from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, up from its original $62.5 million budget.\n",
      "Legends hopes to draw about 3.2 million visitors, or roughly a quarter of the tourists who made their way downtown last year to visit sites such as the National September 11 Memorial  Museum, Wall Street, the Statue of Liberty and the South Street Seaport.\n",
      "But David Checketts, chief executive of Legends, said he was not worried about the competition or whether New York has reached an observatory saturation point.\n",
      "''I imagine the Empire State Building has upped its advertising budget,'' he said.\n",
      "''It's an elevator ride and a view.\n",
      "There's Top of the Rock and there'll be others.\n",
      "They're kind of back in vogue.\n",
      "But I do think this one will be highly desirable, because we're next to the September 11 Memorial, the museum and a resurgent downtown.''\n",

      "The imaginative Brooklyn florist wanted to grow flowers on her own terms.\n",
      "Long winters, lost crops and a creaky old house aside, it's worked out perfectly.\n",
      "World's End, a three-year-old flower farm in Montgomery County, N.Y., is a city girl's dream of a country idyll.\n",
      "The white farmhouse, built in 1825, is low and sprawling, flanked by old-growth lilac, a weathered barn and a lily-filled pond.\n",
      "The kitchen garden is thriving; a small apiary produces honey.\n",
      "Behind the house, fluffy Icelandic sheep graze on rolling fields bordered with neat rows of flowers.\n",
      "From the columbine and the found bird's nest on the workbench table to the weathered pots of white-striped elephant's ears on the piano, from the porch with its gingerbread-house-style moldings to the dust motes dancing in the afternoon air that can only be called sepia-toned -- it is enchanting.\n",
      "I am particularly taken with the distressed layers of antique wallpaper in the front room: tattered 1940s day lilies over variegated green stripes atop an older, vaguely colonial print of washed-out fruit baskets.\n",
      "The effect is highly desirable but, as Sarah Ryhanen explains, the paper isn't intentionally shabby chic -- it's just shabby.\n",
      "After making a couple of rooms in the house habitable, she and her partner, Eric Famisan, put everything else into their flower farm.\n",
      "They also have plans to install a stove, she says; in the meantime, they've been canning home-grown tomatoes over a fire pit.\n",
      "Ryhanen and Famisan have been making hard work look beautiful for a long time.\n",
      "Their Red Hook shop, Saipua, is legendary among New York flower lovers for its unusual arrangements that might combine, say, an heirloom tea rose with a branch of native berries that, in another context, might be passed over as a weed.\n",
      "Saipua bouquets are special.\n",
      "Often involving unusual blooms in rare colors, they're somewhere between a Dutch master's still life and the most extravagant bunch of wildflowers you've ever gathered, at once effortless-looking and imperfectly decadent.\n",
      "As one friend put it, ''Even by Brooklyn flower standards, her aesthetic is truly wild.''\n",
      "And yet neither Ryhanen, 34, or Famisan, 40, grew up around much nature.\n",
      "Ryhanen's love affair with flowers began when, as a 25-year-old assistant curator at an art gallery, she was given a bunch of black dahlias by Famisan.\n",
      "''By the next morning, they had died,'' Ryhanen remembered, driving me back to the farm from Albany's train station earlier this year.\n",
      "''But I realized it didn't matter.\n",
      "Its work had already been done.''\n",
      "In 2006, the couple launched their brick-and-mortar outlet for bouquets and the olive-oil soaps Ryhanen's mother had started making -- the name of the store derives from the Finnish word ''saippua'' or soap -- and, as her passion for flowers grew, Ryhanen's arrangements became an increasingly large part of the business.\n",
      "Initially, she knew the names of ''maybe five common flowers.''\n",
      "She has still never formally studied floral arrangement or horticulture, relying instead on images, instinct and the community of professionals whose work she admires.\n",
      "In a tough economy, florists are often a casualty.\n",
      "A pleasure rather than an essential, flowers become associated with weddings, funerals and Valentine's Day more than everyday life.\n",
      "What's more, they are costly -- and the most expensive varieties are often the shortest-lived.\n",
      "Not everyone wants to see a memento mori on their dining table.\n",
      "After the crash of 2008, Ryhanen was no longer able to find the unique specimens that were so crucial to her signature arrangements.\n",
      "Wholesalers had started to play it safe; New York's 28th Street flower district was made up of walls of tulips, hothouse roses and South American carnations, the sturdy varieties that always sell.\n",
      "The couple came to realize that, if they wanted auricula, black hellebores or bearded brown irises, they were going to have to grow them themselves.\n",
      "And so they found World's End (named for a favorite T.C. Boyle novel).\n",
      "At first, the couple simply planned to grow everything they couldn't find elsewhere.\n",
      "Of course, it didn't take them long to learn why it's so hard to find, say, a blue Himalayan poppy in New York -- particularly growing in the kind of ''challenging'' soil that's more often used for dairy farms than flower beds.\n",
      "But their peony, iris and lilac crops have been robust, and the less tangible rewards have also been great.\n",
      "Ryhanen and Famisan now imagine the farm as a locus for the flower community and an example to other businesses.\n",
      "On a tour of the grounds, she shows me with some pride her compost pile, made largely of leftovers from events, and Saipua's and other florists' waste.\n",
      "Past the lily pond is the 19th-century barn, the refurbishment of which was much more trouble than building a new one would have been -- but has provided a characterful space for teaching, cooking demonstrations and celebrations.\n",
      "Saipua -- and, indeed, Ryhanen herself -- has a cult following among a certain sort of aesthete, attested to by the more than 45,000 followers of the business's Instagram feed, replete with pictures of sheep, buckets of fruit, exquisite bouquets and progress at the farm.\n",
      "Although Ryhanen's blog deals frankly with the realities of agricultural life -- harsh weather, financial challenges and unending hard work -- it is easy for an outsider to cast the whole enterprise in a sort of Hollywood glow.\n",
      "Wandering around, I found myself thinking that the story of the farm would make for a wonderful book -- before realizing that I was anticipating the pleasure of reading such a memoir, at my leisure, rather than imagining the process of writing it while also running two businesses, organizing countless events and coordinating different growing seasons, while also regularly commuting the four hours between Brooklyn and the Hudson Valley.\n",
      "Ryhanen's lifestyle may appear aspirational, just as her seemingly effortless arrangements make a secret part of us feel that maybe we too could conjure such beauty.\n",
      "And yet, experiencing it firsthand, the primary response is awe: She has done it, and the amount of sweat and heartache and energy and sheer competence it has taken is staggering to behold.\n",
      "After our tour -- accompanied by the couple's city-country dog, Nea, and by Ziggy, an excitable young border collie who's just learning how to herd -- we eat bread and cheese and cherries under the shade of an enormous maple tree that the house's former occupant refused to register for fear of hordes of tree lovers descending on the property.\n",
      "Famisan appears from the fields, smiling and calm, with two of the hands (several former summer interns have gone on to be full-time employees of Saipua) and they head into town for ice cream.\n",
      "It's heavenly -- but then, it's spring.\n",
      "This past brutal winter took a major toll on the farm.\n",
      "The isolation, exhaustion and pressure would put strain on any relationship -- but Ryhanen and Famisan work well together.\n",
      "He runs the farm; she looks after the flower store.\n",
      "Her impatience is matched by his steadier temperament.\n",
      "He tackles the myriad engineering challenges.\n",
      "She is more indulgent of the interns' mistakes.\n",
      "The pace of New York retail is fast and exhilarating, but farm work requires a different relationship to time.\n",
      "As Ryhanen explains, you begin to think in terms of potential: what a field will yield in 10 years, a magnolia tree in 35.\n",
      "To say the least, it requires patience as well as acceptance.\n",
      "''The chaos in nature is quiet, latent,'' she says.\n",
      "''A lamb's death is quiet; so is the gradual death of a crop of flowers.''\n",
      "Sitting on the lawn, birds singing from the trees, she remembers that long-ago bunch of black dahlias and sighs.\n",
      "''People look at flowers as objects -- as a decorating element, not a living thing.\n",
      "But sometimes the most beautiful thing is the most fleeting.\n",
      "The most fragrant, delicate rose -- often those wilt in minutes.\n",

      "Senator Marco Rubio of Florida earned glowing praise and predictions about how formidable a contender he would be when he announced his run for the White House in April.\n",
      "Then he disappeared on a two-month fund-raising trip.\n",
      "He grabbed attention again in July on his first extended visit to Iowa -- then quickly returned to the committee meetings and roll-call votes that make up the day-to-day life of a United States senator.\n",
      "Last week, Mr. Rubio delivered one of the strongest performances at the Republican debate in Cleveland, by most accounts.\n",
      "But rather than trying to build on that with a busy schedule of appearances before primary voters, he is off again, this time on a fund-raising swing to Seattle and Southern California.\n",
      "The Rubio presidential campaign so far has been a lot of fits and starts: It impresses.\n",
      "It raises expectations.\n",
      "Then it goes quiet.\n",
      "Mr. Rubio describes this rhythm as part of a long-term plan.\n",
      "Much like Jeb Bush, a fellow Floridian who refers to himself as ''the tortoise'' on a slow and steady path, Mr. Rubio is aiming to keep his head down until the fall, when more voters will be paying attention.\n",
      "''You can't get caught up in it,'' he said with an indifferent shrug, playing down the positive reviews he received after the debate.\n",
      "The pundits commending him now will be just as quick to call him a failure the next time he slips, he said.\n",
      "But the peril for Mr. Rubio is that his opponents -- inside and outside the Republican Party -- are not waiting for him to introduce himself to voters on his own terms.\n",
      "It took Democrats mere seconds to begin attacking Mr. Rubio online during the debate with damning assertions, like ''Marco Rubio has a record of abandoning immigrants.''\n",
      "The Democratic National Committee called his opposition to abortion rights and his support for cutting funding to Planned Parenthood -- he says he would outlaw abortion and he does not favor exceptions for rape and incest -- ''misogyny on full display.''\n",
      "Hillary Rodham Clinton has begun to attack him by name, calling out his beliefs on abortion this week as ''deeply troubling.''\n",
      "Mr. Bush's Republican allies are subtler; they offer backhanded compliments, like the one former Senator Mel Martinez gave recently, saying, ''Marco Rubio will be president someday.''\n",
      "But their message could not be clearer: Mr. Rubio is not ready for the White House.\n",
      "Mr. Bush's campaign showed it was bracing for a scrap with Mr. Rubio.\n",
      "A list of bullet points denigrating Mr. Rubio, posted online by the Bush campaign last week but later taken down, noted that he is a first-term senator, had missed many votes and sponsored only two bills that ever passed the Senate.\n",
      "With Mr. Rubio sliding back toward the middle of the congested Republican pack in most recent polls, some of his top supporters are urging him to raise his visibility and start mixing it up with his rivals more aggressively.\n",

      "''He's not as uptight as some of these other candidates, especially Jeb and others,'' he added.\n",
      "''I think that plays perfectly to where he needs to be.\n",
      "But I do think there's some pressure mounting from the ranks in Marco world from people who want him to rise.\n",
      "He needs to rise to the occasion.''\n",
      "Mr. Rubio's advisers say they have no desire to be sucked into the tit-for-tat news cycle, especially with Donald J. Trump the dominant story.\n",
      "''We are not chasing the headline,'' said Todd Harris, a senior adviser to the Rubio campaign who acknowledged that not all the senator's supporters saw the virtue of keeping a lower profile.\n",
      "''We hear it from all sides, 'What are you guys doing?\n",
      "' But if you look at the truest paths of the last many elections, the best long-term strategy is to be slow and steady.''\n",
      "In interview after interview, Mr. Rubio has largely taken a pass when asked to weigh in on his Republican opponents.\n",
      "He says he does not want to divert the focus from his message.\n",
      "But this has left him open to criticisms that he has not sufficiently condemned Mr. Trump's more provocative comments about immigrants and women.\n",
      "''I've made a decision here with Donald Trump,'' he said on Sunday on NBC News's ''Meet the Press.''\n",
      "''If I comment on everything he says, my whole campaign will be consumed by it.\n",
      "That's all I'll do all day.''\n",
      "Mr. Rubio's preference for staying in his own lane has not entirely spared him of friction or unflattering headlines.\n",
      "During a Senate hearing last month, he told Secretary of State John Kerry that President Obama's nuclear pact with Iran was ''a terrible deal.''\n",
      "That angered Mr. Kerry, who told him that if Congress rejected this deal there could never be another with the Iranians.\n",
      "''If you think the Ayatollah is going to come back and negotiate again with an American, that's fantasy,'' Mr. Kerry said.\n",
      "''You're never going to see that because we will have proven we're not trustworthy.''\n",
      "Mr. Rubio's advisers say they believe, with six months until the first votes are cast, that the real measure of his strength is his strong showing in polls in which voters are asked not who their first choice for president is, but about candidates they could imagine supporting.\n",
      "In a July NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll, for example, 62 percent of people who said they would vote in the Republican primary said they could see themselves voting for Mr. Rubio, a higher percentage than any other Republican.\n",
      "He does still intend to become voters' first choice, of course.\n",
      "Aides say Mr. Rubio will speak out this fall, from his seat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, in opposition to the Iran nuclear deal.\n",
      "And starting in November, his campaign will run a multimillion-dollar ad campaign in Iowa, Nevada, New Hampshire and South Carolina.\n",
      "On Friday, he will deliver a speech in New York that is expected to outline how he would deal with governments that are hostile to the United States.\n",
      "In part, the ads will be meant to compensate for Mr. Rubio's somewhat sporadic presence, compared with his rivals, in those four states, which hold the earliest nominating contests.\n",
      "In a Granite State Poll last week, for example, he had just 3 percent of the vote among Republicans in New Hampshire.\n",
      "Still, for Mr. Rubio and his longtime admirers, this is a familiar and unremarkable place to be.\n",
      "In 2010, after his term as speaker of the Florida House, in what seemed to be an unlikely candidacy for the United States Senate, Mr. Rubio's tiny contingent of supporters gave themselves a nickname borrowed from his standing in the polls: the 3 Percent Club.\n",

      "Senior executives of companies that publish faulty financial statements would have to give back some of their compensation as punishment for the accounting missteps under a rule proposed on Wednesday by the Securities and Exchange Commission.\n",
      "The rule, required by the Dodd-Frank financial overhaul law, which Congress passed in 2010, is aimed at increasing accountability within corporate America.\n",
      "It focuses on executive bonuses, also known as ''incentive-based compensation,'' which have grown consistently larger in recent years.\n",
      "Critics of this pay boom say that it creates incentives for executives to cash out quickly, regardless of whether their companies falter in the ensuing years.\n",
      "The size and payment of bonuses typically depend on whether a company meets or exceeds certain financial metrics, like stock price performance or earnings.\n",
      "As it stands, an executive may get to keep a bonus even if the company artificially inflated those metrics and then corrected the missteps by issuing new financial statements.\n",
      "The S.E.C.'s new rule would enable a company to ''claw back'' bonuses when the financial statements have been restated.\n",
      "The proposed rule will apply to companies listed on United States stock exchanges.\n",
      "''These listing standards will require executive officers to return incentive-based compensation that was not earned,'' Mary Jo White, the S.E.C. chairwoman, said in a statement.\n",
      "''The proposed rules would result in increased accountability and greater focus on the quality of financial reporting, which will benefit investors and the markets.''\n",
      "The S.E.C. has been criticized for taking too long to issue rules that stem from Dodd-Frank.\n",
      "The agency, for instance, has yet to finalize a regulation that requires companies to compare the pay of their chief executives with the median pay of the rest of their employees.\n",
      "In a news release on Wednesday, the S.E.C. noted, perhaps pointedly, that it had completed proposals for all the Dodd-Frank compensation rules.\n",
      "The new ''clawback'' provision is somewhat limited by the requirement that a financial restatement take place.\n",
      "But in other ways, it makes it easier for companies to go after the bonuses earned by current and former employees.\n",
      "Existing rules allow corporations to claw back the pay of the chief executive or chief financial officer, but the new regulation will apply to a much broader group that includes not only other senior officers but also ''any other person who performs policy-making functions for the company,'' according to the S.E.C.  The proposed rule allows for clawbacks even if the financial restatement was not the result of misconduct, something that is required under the existing provisions.\n",
      "And the new rule applies to pay earned over three years, compared with a year under the current regulation.\n",
      "''This rule targets the lack of accountability and the inflated compensation that helped contribute to excessive risk-taking in the run-up to the financial crisis,'' said Kara M. Stein, a Democratic commissioner at the S.E.C. who has pressed the agency to take tougher stances on several issues.\n",
      "In response to the new rule, some companies might decide to adjust their compensation packages so that executives receive more fixed pay, and less in bonuses, to reduce the amounts subject to the new rule.\n",
      "But shareholders, who generally favor bonuses tied to performance instead of large fixed salaries, might push back against such a shift.\n",
      "The new rule allows companies to opt against pursuing a clawback if the costs of doing so might exceed the amount it wants to recover.\n",
      "That aspect of the rule could become a loophole.\n",
      "It might not be hard for companies to show that the legal costs of going after a bonus would exceed the size of the bonus.\n",
      "The authorities are overhauling compensation on other fronts as well.\n",
      "The S.E.C. and banking regulators are working together on compensation rules that focus on pay at financial institutions.\n",
      "In addition, the Federal Reserve has instituted compensation guidelines that apply in particular to the big Wall Street banks it regulates.\n",
      "These can require a bank to claw back the pay of an employee even when a financial restatement has not taken place and even when no loss has occurred.\n",
      "European regulators are also scrutinizing banker pay.\n",
      "European rules limit bankers' bonuses to the equivalent of their annual salaries, or to two times their base salaries if the company's shareholders approve it.\n",
      "And Britain has taken a tough stance on clawbacks.\n",
      "Its regulators recently announced new rules under which top executives and managers at banks operating in the country, including units of United States banks, could have their bonuses clawed back for up to 10 years after any finding of misconduct.\n",
      "Senior managers, risk managers and others at banks will also be asked to defer more of their variable pay for a longer period, making it easier for regulators and financial institutions to recover bonuses if misconduct is uncovered.\n",

      "Vojislav Kostunica today made the first visit to Sarajevo by a Yugoslav head of state since war broke out here eight years ago, hastily starting a dialogue of peace to soften what many see as his support for Serbian nationalism.\n",
      "Mr. Kostunica had planned today's journey to Trebinje, high in the mountains that divide Bosnia from Montenegro, as a personal and symbolic pilgrimage to honor Jovan Ducic, a Serbian poet and diplomat born here and reburied with great pomp today, 57 years after he died in the United States.\n",
      "But the trip to the Serb-ruled part of Bosnia, where many inhabitants still hope to rejoin neighboring Yugoslavia, quickly turned into a highly political act, threatening to raise tensions barely two weeks after a popular uprising swept Mr. Kostunica, the elected president, into power in place of Slobodan Milosevic.\n",
      "Mr. Milosevic has long been seen as a fulcrum of the Balkan wars of the past decade, and the instigator of the Serb attack on independent Bosnia that set off a war that claimed an estimated 200,000 lives and drove some 2 million of Bosnia's 4.3 million inhabitants from their homes.\n",
      "Under pressure from international officials in charge of Bosnia, Mr. Kostunica flew to the Bosnian capital, Sarajevo, for a short meeting at the airport with Bosnian officials after attending the emotional and patriotic reburial of Mr. Ducic.\n",
      "Mr. Kostunica did not venture into Sarajevo itself, a city which was bombarded and besieged by the Bosnian Serbs throughout the war, restricting himself to meeting at Sarajevo airport with Bosnian Croat officials and the Muslim and Serb members of the tripartite presidency that runs the still deeply divided country.\n",
      "He said afterward, \"I would say we are opening a new page in relations\".\n",
      "The immediate goal was to discuss the resumption of diplomatic relations between Bosnia and Yugoslavia, although according to Halid Genjac, the Muslim member of the presidency, talks did not go very far, Reuters reported from Sarajevo.\n",
      "Asked if he would apologize for Serbian actions during the war, Mr. Kostunica reiterated his stance that everyone's actions should be examined and that \"one-sided statements\" would not solve anything.\n",
      "\"I am one of those politicians who will not use empty words, empty promises and empty apologies to in some way overcome all the complications of our relations,\" Reuters quoted him as saying.\n",
      "\"With all that has happened, all the crimes that were carried out and the victims there were on all sides, all this can be cured only by the truth\".\n",
      "\"We need a return of confidence, an examination of all that happened a few years ago and maybe a few decades ago,\" Mr. Kostunica added, alluding apparently to the World War II feuds and killings that helped stoke the disputes and wars of the 1980's and 90's.\n",
      "In a significant change from previous comments, Mr. Kostunica indicated that he would cooperate with the war crimes tribunal at The Hague, which has indicted high-level Serbian officials and generals for their actions in Bosnia and, for his actions in Kosovo, Mr. Milosevic.\n",
      "\"When it comes to The Hague tribunal, we know it is a part of the Dayton accord and there are elements of it which can and must be implemented and we will take certain steps in that direction,\" Mr. Kostunica said, referring to the peace accords that ended the Bosnian war and divided the country into the Muslim-Croat Federation and the Serb Republic.\n",
      "Mr. Milosevic visited Bosnia only once during the war, in 1993, when he urged the Bosnian Serbs to accept an international peace settlement which they rejected.\n",
      "Mr. Kostunica, a lawyer who espouses Serbian patriotism but has criticized ethnic cleansing and the paramilitaries involved in it, was apparently determined to attend the reburial of Mr. Ducic, despite the evident concern of foreign diplomats who effectively administer Bosnia.\n",
      "Jacques Klein, a retired American general who heads the United Nations mission to Bosnia, flew personally to take Mr. Kostunica to Sarajevo.\n",
      "He called the trip a brave one on Mr. Kostunica's part, considering the Yugoslav president is still grappling with the supporters of Mr. Milosevic.\n",
      "\"Kostunica deserves great credit.\n",
      "His advisers probably would have said, 'Don't do this.\n",
      "It's going to cause you problems in Belgrade,' \" Mr. Klein said.\n",
      "Mr. Kostunica was applauded by hundreds of bystanders as he arrived at the newly-built Church of the Annunciation, where Mr. Ducic was to be buried.\n",
      "\"Long life, Mr. President,\" said one onlooker.\n",
      "Following dozens of Serb Orthodox priests in colored robes and glittering miters, Mr. Kostunica accompanied Bosnian Serb politicians around the church and inside for an hours-long service.\n",
      "Beside him stood his host, Mirko Sarovic, vice president of the Serb Republic and a leader of the nationalist Serbian Democratic Party.\n",
      "\"It's a private visit, but it is turning into a public occasion,\" said Vladeta Jankovic, a leading adviser to Mr. Kostunica.\n",
      "\"People tend to see this as a provocation, which it isn't\".\n",
      "\"This is certainly not meant to be a demonstration of Serb nationalism and that is why he is going to Sarajevo\".\n",
      "Mr. Kostunica's visit to Trebinje had been planned long before he had even thought of running for president, Mr. Jankovic said.\n",
      "But many Serbs attending saw it as an important political moment.\n",
      "\"All these people are from Serbia and for us the border does not exist.\n",
      "Of course, I want this to become part of Yugoslavia, and not Bosnia,\" said Nikola Miljanovic, a businessman.\n",
      "This open desire to change Bosnia's borders alarms the Muslim and Croat inhabitants of Bosnia, many of whom suffered at the hands of Serbian forces during the war.\n",
      "In Trebinje, as in many other places, the Muslims were expelled and their mosques destroyed.\n",
      "Mr. Kostunica did not speak at Trebinje and bore an expression of detachment as he stood listening to the speeches and sermons.\n",
      "The occasion was replete with the kind of religious and patriotic symbols that nationalist Bosnian Serb leaders made their hallmark during the 1992-1995 war.\n",
      "A popular Serbian poet, Matija Beckovic, spoke of the miracle that had brought the body of Mr. Ducic back to Trebinje at the very moment that Serbia found freedom and democracy under Mr. Kostunica, who defeated Mr. Milosevic in elections on Sept.\n",
      "24.\n",
      "His speech won applause at almost every sentence.\n",

      "HOW many home cooks have the time or inclination on a busy weeknight to create a velvety leek puree, prepare a glossy lamb jus and coat perfectly trimmed lamb loins with a crust of fine black trumpet mushroom crumbs?\n",
      "Not many, even if they are sophisticated cooks.\n",
      "But starting next week, the ingredients for seven restaurant-quality dinners for two, created by seven top chefs, will be available in kits.\n",
      "All the home cook has to do is follow simple cooking directions and serve.\n",
      "No matter how elaborate the dishes sound, Impromptu Gourmet, in Valley Cottage, N.Y., promises that they will take less than 30 minutes from when the box is opened to when the food is served.\n",
      "Based on the three dinners that I tried, the estimate is on target.\n",
      "No special equipment is needed to heat the sauces and vegetables or to cook the fish or meat.\n",
      "And no special skills.\n",
      "The explicit, easily followed instructions usually involve no more than a quick saute or putting meat on a grill.\n",
      "If you have never seared raw tuna or lamb, you will learn how.\n",
      "Nothing is put in a microwave oven.\n",
      "Take the lamb dish above, which was created by Jean-Georges Vongerichten, the chef and owner of Jean Georges and other restaurants.\n",
      "The kit includes raw crusted lamb loins, ready to sear; finely minced chives; and leek puree, lamb jus, precooked mushrooms and wild rice, all to be reheated.\n",
      "The ingredients are fresh, not frozen, and are packed mostly in Cryovac.\n",
      "They have a shelf life of three days in the refrigerator.\n",
      "At $35, the kits are not inexpensive, but I think they are worth the money.\n",
      "Impromptu Gourmet is not the only company to jump on what may be a trend.\n",
      "Cookbox in Long Island City, Queens, offers similar dinner kits, also taking 30 minutes to prepare, but on a more modest level (more ethnic dishes, less expensive ingredients, no top chefs).\n",

      "Kits like these save you hours of shopping for ingredients, like the microgreens that David Burke, the chef at Park Avenue Cafe, uses with his marinated grilled filet mignon with grilled tomatoes and asparagus on a bed of polenta.\n",
      "And even more important, the quality of the ingredients is, by and large, vastly superior to what a consumer will find, even in high-end markets.\n",
      "The two nine-ounce slabs of tuna in the kit designed by Peter Kelly, the owner of Xaviar's in Piermont and Garrison, N.Y., are strictly restaurant caliber.\n",
      "Mr. Kelly, whose easy and delicious tuna with wasabi crust goes on a seaweed salad, is a founder of Impromptu Gourmet.\n",
      "Gray Kunz, the former chef at Lespinasse, created seared red snapper with a tamarind and lime-leaf reduction.\n",
      "Eric Ripert of Le Bernardin made shrimp with bok choy and soy-ginger vinaigrette.\n",
      "Charlie Palmer of Aureole created duck with pomegranate molasses, and Michael Romano, of Union Square Cafe, offers lamb chops with a casserole of Italian white beans and salad.\n",
      "The chefs said they became involved in the project because of the quality Impromptu Gourmet guaranteed.\n",
      "\"The chefs insisted that we go to their suppliers for the ingredients, and we did,\" Mr. Kelly said.\n",

      "Prices soon rallied, but the Dow Jones industrial average still closed under 10,000 for the first time since March.\n",
      "The wild gyrations reflected one of the most confused and divided stock markets in memory, in which hopes that the market is about to rise again are balanced by worries that weakness in technology stocks may presage a bear market and a sharp slowing in the economy that will decimate corporate profits.\n",
      "\"People are asking themselves if this is the end of the sell-off,\" said William Rhodes, the chief equity strategist for Williams Capital.\n",
      "At the same time, he added, there is fear that stock prices had reflected overly optimistic expectations about earnings growth in coming years.\n",
      "During the last six weeks, stock prices have fallen sharply across much of the market, with some well-known stocks, like Yahoo and Apple Computer, losing more than half their value amid signs that growth is slowing for many technology companies.\n",
      "That weakness, amplified into 80 percent or larger declines for some smaller stocks, has led to forced selling as some investors tried to contain their losses.\n",
      "Worries about high oil prices -- which were intensified by a report of low inventories released Tuesday night -- also have contributed to the nervousness of investors.\n",

      "And then the market turned around.\n",
      "Within a couple of hours, the Nasdaq index had erased its entire loss and was up a bit for the day.\n",
      "The Dow was still down, but all of the decline could be attributed to two stocks with bad news: I.B.M. and J. P. Morgan.\n",
      "I.B.M. reported disappointing revenue while J. P. Morgan was hurt by losses in venture capital investments at Chase Manhattan, which is acquiring Morgan.\n",
      "By the close, the Dow was down 114.69 points, to 9,975.02.\n",
      "But nearly all of that decline was caused by I.B.M., and there were as many Dow stocks with gains as there were with losses.\n",
      "The Nasdaq index ended down 1.3 percent, a relatively small move in this very volatile time, while the Standard & Poor's 500-stock index was off just over 0.5 percent.\n",
      "The Wall Street rebound had immediate international effects as well.\n",
      "European stocks, which had been sliding, generally turned around about the same time.\n",
      "But, perhaps in an indication that some of the buying of American stocks came from abroad, the euro also began to fall, hitting a record low against the dollar for the first time since central banks intervened to support the currency last month.\n",
      "The euro traded as low as 83.3 cents.\n",
      "I.B.M., which ended the day down $17.56, to $95.44 a share, disappointed investors with a profit report that showed revenue running below expectations.\n",
      "But even as I.B.M. was plunging in early trading, the Dow was getting some support from Intel, which ended up $2, to $38.19.\n",
      "Its actual profit report was not as bad as it had led analysts to fear last month, and that strength helped to buoy investors.\n",
      "\"You do see companies that are trying to find bottoms here,\" said Giri Devalupally, a technology analyst at T. Rowe Price, a mutual fund company.\n",
      "He pointed to the gains yesterday in both Intel and Dell Computer, each of which has lost more than half its value since peaking earlier in the year.\n",
      "Coming into yesterday, much attention was focused on Sun Microsystems, which was scheduled to release profits after the market closed.\n",
      "But in mid-morning it put a bullish headline about its earnings on its Internet site, sending the stock leaping 10 percent, to $118.75, in 20 minutes, as analysts struggled to extrapolate the underlying profit numbers from a headline.\n",
      "Trading was soon halted, and the full profit release was issued.\n",
      "Sun rose a bit more, then sagged as some analysts voiced concern that its gross profit margins had fallen.\n",
      "By the close, the shares were back down to $110.31, off $1.06 for the day.\n",
      "Even while technology stocks have bounced wildly in recent weeks on each new piece of evidence regarding the state of demand, other shares have been helped by the fact that optimism for the overall stock market remains strong among many investors.\n",
      "Ever since the 1987 crash -- whose 13th anniversary is today -- big falls in stocks have been viewed as buying opportunities, and investors have been willing to come in when prices fall sharply.\n",
      "Ameritrade, an online brokerage firm, reported that during the nine trading sessions before yesterday, its traders were net buyers on every day except last Friday, when some took profits on a strong rebound that gave the Nasdaq market its second-best day ever.\n",
      "David Bowers, the chief global investment strategist for Merrill Lynch, noted that some investors were taking heart from the fact that both the Dow and the Nasdaq indexes had approached the spring lows last week, and again yesterday, before stabilizing and turning up.\n",
      "Trying to analyze the market now is difficult because the end of October is the time that most mutual funds close their tax books for the year.\n",
      "That has created selling pressure as some funds have taken capital losses that can be used to offset capital gains taken earlier in the year on other stocks.\n",
      "Just which stock funds have losses can vary widely, reflecting the huge gains many had before stocks began to fall.\n",
      "Lucent Technologies, for example, is down more than two-thirds from the high it reached late last year, but it is still trading for more than twice its value of four years ago.\n",
      "Intel is down about half from the peak it reached in September, but is still twice where it was two years ago.\n",
      "Microsoft traded at a two-year low this week for the first time in its history, but is still far above where it was three or four years ago.\n",
      "All those stocks still have Wall Street adherents and clearly will remain major companies for years to come.\n",
      "The worst losses have come as nearly all investors have abandoned some of last year's Internet plays.\n",
      "For example, Stamps.com, a company that sells postage over the Internet, has seen turmoil in top management ranks and now sells for less than $3 a share, down from a high of $98.50 last November and less than half the amount of cash per share the company has in the bank.\n",

      "There came a point during Tuesday's performance of Rossini's ''L'Italiana in Algeri'' at the Metropolitan Opera when I vowed I would stop laughing at the sophomoric spectacle in front of me.\n",
      "I think it was when the chorus of masked, rubber-bellied eunuchs started whipping a row of twerking harem girls, in sync with the music.\n",
      "I had already cringed at the extravagant black-tufted wigs that covered the chest and back of the bass Ildar Abdrazakov in a scene showing his character, the Algerian bey Mustafà, in his bath.\n",
      "And I had stared, with alarmed bemusement, at Mr. Abdrazakov's soft-shoeing, air-guitar-playing, floor-pounding performance, which seemed to grow more unhinged as the evening wore on.\n",
      "But my resolution came to naught.\n",
      "Jean-Pierre Ponnelle's 1973 staging of this battle of the sexes, framed by Rossini and his librettist as an abduction drama, may be the silliest and most stereotype-laden production in the Met's repertory.\n",
      "But it's still very funny -- irresistibly so, as I found out.\n",
      "This revival is conducted by James Levine, making his first appearance in his new role as music director emeritus.\n",
      "He conducted this effervescent music with a steady hand, sure pacing and an eye for instances of opulent instrumental color, which are tucked in among the otherwise briskly efficient score.\n",
      "The opera's female lead is Isabella, a feisty Italian captive who uses charm, wit and mountains of pasta to spring free her lover, Lindoro, who was taken into slavery some months earlier.\n",
      "The vocally challenging Isabella -- requiring nimble coloratura and a certain earthiness in the form of a grounded low register -- had been planned for the American mezzo-soprano Elizabeth DeShong.\n",
      "But illness forced her to withdraw, leaving the Italian mezzo Marianna Pizzolato to take over, in her Met debut.\n",
      "The froufrou production, with its over-the-top performances, proved a fine foil for Ms. Pizzolato's matronly, no-nonsense presence and her dark-toned, coolly assured singing and crystal-clear diction.\n",
      "Marshaling all the matter-of-fact bossiness of an Italian mama, she disarmed the vainglorious Mustafà.\n",
      "René Barbera, also in his first Met appearance, brought a light, urbane tenor to the role of Lindoro, the somewhat colorless object of Isabella's affections and intrigue.\n",
      "The suave baritone Nicola Alaimo was almost miscast as the hapless Taddeo, singing with elegance and richness of tone.\n",
      "The sunny-voiced soprano Ying Fang perfectly inhabited the part of Elvira, Mustafà's jilted, ditsy wife.\n",
      "The vibrant Canadian-Tunisian mezzo Rihab Chaieb, as Elvira's slave, Zulma, and the solid baritone Dwayne Croft, as the put-upon pirate captain Haly, offered strong support.\n",
      "But the evening belonged, for better or worse, to Mr. Abdrazakov.\n",
      "His eye-rolling, pantomiming performance sometimes grew exhausting, but vocally, he remained focused and resonant in every angle and turn of the sometimes preposterous coloratura passages Rossini assigned to him.\n",
      "At the end of the opera, his character collapses into gluttonous silence.\n",
      "When Mustafà realizes that in the meantime, the Italians have made their escape, there is little left for him to do except throw fistfuls of spaghetti after them.\n",

      "He didn't wait as long for a follow-up.\n",
      "''Lighthouse,'' due out on Oct.\n",
      "21, is a collection of new songs performed in a sparse acoustic setting, with a warm, bright light trained on his voice and guitar.\n",
      "Mr. Crosby -- who has been inducted twice into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, as a member of both the Byrds and Crosby, Stills & Nash -- made the album with Michael League, the bassist and producer-composer who leads the Grammy-winning groove band Snarky Puppy.\n",
      "''We recorded the album in 16 days,'' Mr. Crosby said.\n",
      "''I've never done a record that fast -- ever, in my life, ever.''\n",
      "(''Lighthouse'' is being released on Snarky Puppy's label, GroundUP, which has distribution through the Verve Label Group.\n",
      ") In their first casual session together, Mr. Crosby and Mr. League wrote three songs in as many days, ''and they were three of the best songs I've written in years,'' said Mr. Crosby, who turned 75 on Sunday.\n",
      "He'll play some of the songs from the new album on his current tour, ''An Evening With David Crosby,'' backed only by his son James Raymond on piano and vocals.\n",
      "Before embarking on the tour -- which begins on Thursday at the South Orange Performing Arts Center in New Jersey and runs through mid-September -- Mr. Crosby called to discuss the album and his state of mind.\n",
      "These are edited excerpts from the conversation.\n",
      "One point of reference for a stripped-down album like this is Rick Rubin's work with Johnny Cash, which feels so bone-dry and exposed.\n",
      "That's not what this is.\n",
      "No.\n",
      "But if you had Johnny Cash, that's what you'd do with him, too, isn't it?\n",
      "[Laughs]  Michael League has said he was thinking about your album ''If I Could Only Remember My Name.''\n",
      "Was that something that came up in conversation?\n",
      "Oh, yeah.\n",
      "Michael, like a lot of people, really liked that record, my first solo record, and listened to it a lot of times.\n",
      "A lot of people have; it's a good record.\n",
      "I'm being completely immodest, of course, but there you go.\n",
      "So that's where he got the idea that he wanted to do primarily acoustic guitar tracks, with large and fairly intricate vocal stacks.\n",
      "But this record had its own personality right from the get-go, as soon as we started recording it.\n",
      "And it's not the same perspective that you had in 1971.\n",
      "No.\n",
      "I'm a lot happier now.\n",
      "[Video: David Crosby - \"Things We Do for Love\" Watch on YouTube.\n",
      "]  On ''Croz,'' there's a song called ''Time I Have.''\n",
      "You start it by singing: ''People do so many things that make me mad/But angry isn't how I want to spend what time I have.''\n",
      "Does that mind-set extend to this album?\n",
      "I spent a lot of my life angry, and I don't want to, because the less life you have left, the more you treasure it, and the more you are trying to use every minute to accomplish something.\n",
      "That attitude, which comes with age, is all through this record.\n",
      "There's a choice to be made with every minute that you spend.\n",
      "And I'm spending mine having fun, man, and creating.\n",
      "At the same time, there are a couple of songs on this album that are very pointed in their critique.\n",
      "Oh, yeah.\n",
      "''Look in Their Eyes'' addresses the Syrian refugee crisis.\n",
      "What was the genesis of that song?\n",
      "I have a dear and longtime friend, Marsha Williams, who's a member of Human Rights Watch, and she goes to Greece and just tries to help.\n",
      "She was telling me about a day when they pulled 1,000 people out of the water, including 70 dead ones: men, women and children.\n",
      "I was very emotionally affected by her story.\n",
      "And as songwriters, part of our job is to make you boogie; part of our job is to take you on a little emotional voyage; but part of our job is to be the town crier and say: Look, these are human beings.\n",
      "They're just like you.\n",
      "They're trying to keep their kids alive.\n",
      "There have been some recent comparisons in the press between the state of our culture and politics this year and the tinderbox of 1968.\n",
      "What's your response to that?\n",
      "I think there's some parallel.\n",
      "The idea that Trump could get to be the candidate of a major party, that's very disturbing.\n",
      "The situation with regards to us and our military posture with the rest of the world, that's very disturbing.\n",
      "There's a ton of really, really scary things.\n",
      "Global warming.\n",
      "Atmospheric poisoning.\n",
      "All of that stuff is critical and crucial, and affecting the overall mess that we're in.\n",
      "I don't think it's the same, but I think that are certain parts of it that resonate.\n",
      "Racially, too.\n",
      "What about your voice itself, and where you are as a singer?\n",
      "I can't explain how I even have a voice, after all the bad things I did to it.\n",
      "But here I am, I've got it and truthfully think I'm singing as well as I ever have.\n",

      "''Debate'' is an iffy word for an exercise in which candidates are prompted by moderators to dole out their stump speeches bit by bit under hot lights while a clock counts the seconds and every quip and jab and stumble is used to keep score and proclaim a ''winner.''\n",
      "But when just one candidate is serious and the other is a vacuous bully, the term loses all meaning.\n",
      "Monday night's confrontation between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton was a spectacle, for sure: the sheer reality-TV hugeness of it, the Super Bowl audience of tens of millions.\n",
      "''Debate of the Century,'' said The Drudge Report.\n",
      "''America on the Brink,'' said The Huffington Post.\n",
      "For once, the hype may have been about right, given the tightness of the polls and the nearness of the election.\n",
      "There was a fundamental asymmetry to the exercise, because of the awful truth that one of the participants had nothing truthful to offer.\n",
      "But seeing them on the same stage distilled exactly who they have been throughout this campaign.\n",
      "Standing at the lectern, interrupting and shouting, playing the invisible accordion with his open hands, filibustering, tossing his word salads -- jobs and terrorism and Nafta and China and everything is terrible -- Mr. Trump said a lot.\n",
      "But as the debate wore on, he struggled to contend with an opponent who was much more poised and prepared than any of the Republicans he faced in the primaries.\n",
      "Ninety minutes was never going to be enough time for Mr. Trump to redeem his candidacy, even if by some miracle he had wanted to, if he had suddenly developed a coherent set of policies and principles, an agenda against which Mrs. Clinton's proposals could be weighed and reviewed, and a baseline level of decency.\n",
      "The moderator, Lester Holt of NBC News, announced the preset themes of ''achieving prosperity,'' ''America's direction'' and ''securing America,'' then meekly retreated into silence as Mr. Trump went on the attack, blaming Mrs. Clinton for ISIS and joblessness and globalization, depicting the country as a living hell for black Americans, a land beset by illegal immigrants and gangs with guns, with police officers afraid to stop them.\n",
      "''It's all sound bites,'' he said at one point, meaning to disparage Mrs. Clinton, but unwittingly describing the emptiness of his own words.\n",
      "Depending on how your lenses are polarized, Mr. Trump met/exceeded/failed to meet expectations, which were low to begin with.\n",
      "He has lied compulsively since he entered the race, and he was caught again on Monday night with his pants on fire (repeating, among other lies, his slander that Mrs. Clinton invented the birther slur against President Obama).\n",
      "But anything short of dropping his pants in the Hofstra University auditorium would still have left him with the support of a large portion of the American electorate.\n",
      "Mrs. Clinton also met/exceeded/failed to meet expectations, which were different for her.\n",
      "She had to have just enough levity, mixed with substance, to be stern but not shrill, funny but not flippant, smart but not pedantic, able to stand up to bullying.\n",
      "On balance, she pulled it off, swatting his attacks aside and confidently delivering her own criticisms from higher, firmer ground.\n",
      "A more appealing and competent set of primary candidates might have stopped this.\n",
      "A responsible Republican Party, mindful of the national interest, not obsessed with thwarting President Obama, might have stopped it.\n",

      "Look, Mom, there I am in WikiLeaks.\n",
      "Right there among the rest of the media sellouts, Clinton shills and biased tools of the MSM who are apparently bent on destroying Donald J. Trump.\n",
      "Sarah Palin tweeted about me, Trump himself derided my actions in a stump speech and I'm pretty sure Bill O'Reilly just called on me to resign, if I'm reading the barrage of Twitter mentions correctly - and it is a barrage (or was before I stopped reading Twitter).\n",
      "This is all because of those \"damn emails,\" as Bernie Sanders would say, although he was referring to a different bunch of damn emails.\n",
      "These belonged to John Podesta, the Clinton campaign chairman whose hacked emails WikiLeaks has been releasing in daily batches over the last few days.\n",
      "In all, the emails offer a glimpse into the Clinton campaign as the crucible of control-freakishness you would expect.\n",
      "Pretty much any reporter who has covered this enterprise can attest to its stinginess with information and access to the candidate.\n",
      "Official interviews between reporters and campaign aides tend to be aggressively monitored and ground-ruled.\n",
      "Clinton recently broke an ignominious streak of 275 consecutive days without holding a formal news conference.\n",
      "As I detail in an article in this Sunday's magazine, an argument actually broke out aboard the Clinton plane between campaign aides and the traveling press corps over whether it was O.K. for reporters to tweet the candidate's apparent preference for Vladimir Putin as a dinner companion over Donald Trump (as revealed in a note scrawled on a clementine - it's complicated, just read the article).\n",
      "But the leaked emails make for instructive reading nonetheless, though they can be somewhat uncomfortable, if you happen to be the author and recipient of a few of them.\n",
      "By way of background: In July of last year, I embarked on a profile of the former secretary of state a few months after she began seeking the Democratic nomination.\n",
      "True to form, her campaign was nervous and hypercontrolling from the outset, a point that I fleshed out in the story.\n",
      "I described, among other things, the experience of visiting Clinton's Brooklyn headquarters and receiving, before I arrived, an email request from a press aide requesting that I keep \"the office itself\" off the record.\n",
      "In other words, they wanted me not to relay anything that I saw inside the entire 40,000-square-foot space, as if I were being granted access to a top-secret Pentagon bunker or something.\n",
      "It was a ridiculous request that I refused.\n",
      "I also said no initially when the campaign said I could interview Secretary Clinton but only on the condition that we do it off the record.\n",
      "Reporters speak off the record to politicians all the time, but this was an unusual provision and felt slightly weird: a major candidate for president's agreeing to speak to a reporter on the condition that readers not be privy?\n",
      "It would be one thing if the campaign had also agreed to an on-the-record discussion, but it had not.\n",
      "I pleaded my case over a few weeks, but Clinton's staff was not budging.\n",
      "I discussed the dilemma with my bosses - the principle at stake versus the payoff of what I could learn in an off-the-record setting.\n",
      "Finally, I agreed to an off-the-record interview.\n",
      "At the very least, I figured I could pitch Clinton directly on doing an actual interview without any mediation from her army of agonizers.\n",
      "Clinton and I spoke for about 45 minutes in a conference room of the Omni Mount Washington resort in Bretton Woods, N.H.\n",
      "She is, as advertised, \"funny and thoughtful in one-on-one and small-group settings\" (even the Clinton clichés are clichés at this point).\n",
      "Donors pay top dollar for the opportunity to experience this \"funny and thoughtful Hillary in one-on-one and small-group settings\".\n",
      "I paid only with annoyance and a few pounds of dignity.\n",
      "Nonetheless, it was a good discussion, and I learned some things.\n",
      "Clinton touched on a number of topics, from the long-term psychological effects of the internet on young people, to the challenges of running for president as a woman, to how her experience seeking the presidency this time differed from 2008.\n",
      "After our conversation, I asked her aides if they would allow me to put any of our discussion on the record.\n",
      "It was their prerogative to decide, given the off-the-record provision to which I had agreed.\n",
      "I sent large portions of the Clinton transcript in an email to Jennifer Palmieri, the campaign communications director.\n",
      "\"These exchanges were pretty interesting,\" I wrote.\n",
      "\"Would love the option to use\".\n",
      "Ideally Palmieri would have reviewed portions of the interview - about 2,000 words - and come back with a simple \"Fine, use what you want\".\n",
      "There was nothing damning or embarrassing in there, at least that I could tell.\n",
      "I heard nothing for a few days.\n",
      "Palmieri shared my email with others in the campaign, including Podesta, apparently.\n",
      "Finally, after consulting with Clinton herself, Palmieri said they would agree to put two sections of the interview on the record.\n",
      "One of them was an icebreaker exchange between Clinton and me in which I mentioned that I had just seen a moose on the side of the New Hampshire road.\n",
      "This elicited an animated response from Clinton about how she herself had encountered lots of moose up-close when she worked in Alaska one summer during college.\n",
      "Simple enough, right?\n",
      "Well, not quite.\n",
      "Palmieri demanded that I not include an aside that Clinton made in the midst of her moose monologue - about Sarah Palin.\n",
      "Now it can be told.\n",
      "\"I always got a big kick out of Sarah Palin with all of her 'We're cooking up some moose stew here,' \" Clinton told me.\n",
      "She did not seem to be belittling the former Alaska governor in any way, though I should also point out - and this does not come through in the transcript - that Clinton uttered her \"we're cooking up some moose stew here\" line with a passable Palin impersonation.\n",
      "I have no idea why Clinton would not want this Palin aside in the article, though I'm guessing she did not want to invite a public back-and-forth with Palin, as can happen.\n",
      "As it turns out, one of the \"newsier\" takeaways from this week's WikiLeaks trove involved the Palin remark.\n",
      "\"NY Times' Mark Leibovich Obeyed Request to Cut Palin Joke From Hillary Interview,\" said a headline Tuesday in Breitbart, the adamantly pro-Trump news site.\n",
      "Putting aside that it wasn't really a joke, the word \"obeyed\" here goes to the essence of the criticism, mockery and vitriol I've been receiving from the right in recent days.\n",
      "\"Hillary, let's make a deal\"!\n",
      "Palin tweeted on Wednesday.\n",
      "\"I'll swap ya - my special moose chili recipe for your nifty-shifty trick that lets you edit media coverage of yourself\".\n",
      "Or as Trump put it Wednesday night at a rally in Florida, The Times granted Clinton \"veto power over her quotes in a story,\" he said.\n",
      "\"Nobody ever called and said, 'Mr. Trump, we've written this story, would you give us a little feedback?\n",
      "' \" This is obviously not what happened in my case, but given the sausage-grinding revealed in the leaked back-and-forth, I can see how the uninitiated might get that impression.\n",
      "Politicians in fact go \"off the record\" with reporters with some frequency.\n",
      "As soon as the reporter grants the off-the-record provision, he is effectively allowing \"veto power\" over that material.\n",
      "That part of the conversation remains private unless he or she says otherwise.\n",
      "That's the \"nifty-shifty trick\" Palin was referring to.\n",
      "Trump, for his part, goes off the record with reporters all the time.\n",
      "Last September, I spent several hours over a period of a few weeks with the Donald himself for an article in this magazine.\n",
      "On several occasions, in the midst of our conversations, Trump would go off the record - usually with good reason.\n",
      "This was fine, understandable and, yes, the price of \"doing business,\" to adapt an unfortunate phrase that Palmieri used to sign off on our last Wiki-Leaked email (\"Pleasure doing business\"!\n",
      ").\n",
      "I wish Palmieri had not used those exact words, but there are in fact collusive aspects to these relationships.\n",
      "Political profiles are, by definition, an awkward dance that involves competing agendas, mutual cynicism and, in many cases, negotiation.\n",
      "It can involve great levels of trust and distrust at the same time.\n",
      "I've written a few hundred of these profiles over the years, and each dynamic is complicated for its own particular reasons.\n",
      "Looking back, I realize that Trump's campaign was a relative pleasure to deal with compared with the coiled thicket of Clintonia.\n",
      "His was a simple and nimble operation, consisting at the time of just himself and his communications director, Hope Hicks.\n",
      "Decisions came fast and without obvious hand-wringing, usually from the candidate himself.\n",
      "Trump was more than generous with his time, access and willingness to say provocative things.\n",
      "He was the anti-Hillary in this regard, just as Clinton is the anti-Trump in other regards.\n",
      "But Trump was hardly unplugged or unaware.\n",
      "A lot of the stuff he said to me that he declared to be \"off the record\" was potentially harmful to him.\n",
      "He was fully conscious of where lines were, whom he did not want to be disparaging publicly and of what could bring needless offense.\n",
      "He trusted me to honor this agreement, and of course I did, and will continue to.\n",
      "If I had asked Trump, after the fact, whether I could put some of that material \"on the record,\" it would have been his right to say no, to exercise his veto power.\n",
      "As it turned out, there might have been one or two off-the-record things I asked him if I could use in our final conversations, but I don't recall exactly.\n",
      "Another advantage of writing about Trump: He does give you plenty to work with.\n",
      "For as media-friendly as he was, Trump has been equally hostile to the \"unfair\" and \"dishonest\" press - increasingly so, and to a point where it's reaching an unnervingly fevered pitch.\n",
      "\"Without the press, Hillary Clinton would be nothing,\" Trump railed Thursday at a rally in Florida.\n",
      "The Times and The Washington Post are mere \"cogs for a corrupt political machine,\" he said.\n",
      "These are days of many cogs in Trump's America - everything from the Republican officials who Trump says have abandoned him to the United States Justice Department to the women accusing him of sexual harassment.\n",
      "But the media is first among cogs, probably the first entity Trump will blame if he doesn't win.\n",
      "\"The corrupt establishment knows we are a great threat to their criminal enterprise,\" Trump said Thursday.\n",
      "We are all part of the enterprise, \"doing business\" together.\n",
      "We know all the secret handshakes and nifty-shifty tricks.\n",

      "Why are Michigan’s prosecutors ignoring the Supreme Court?\n",
      "Across the state, they are flouting the justices’ clear message in two recent decisions.\n",
      "The first ruling, in 2012, banned mandatory life-without-parole sentences for juveniles in homicide cases.\n",
      "While the court did not prohibit life-without-parole sentences for juveniles completely, it has said that punishment should be used only in the rarest cases — when the defendant “exhibits such irretrievable depravity that rehabilitation is impossible”.\n",
      "In January, the justices clarified that this rule applies not just going forward but to every inmate already serving such a sentence, or about 2,500 people nationwide.\n",
      "Michigan prisons house 363 of these inmates.\n",
      "All but a very few should be resentenced to shorter terms, with the possibility of parole.\n",
      "Yet prosecutors are seeking to keep more than half of them locked up forever.\n",
      "In Wayne County, which includes Detroit and is responsible for about 150 such inmates, the county prosecutor, Kym Worthy, wants to resentence at least 60 of these people to life without parole.\n",
      "In Oakland County, outside Detroit, the county prosecutor, Jessica Cooper, is seeking life without parole for 44 of the 49 currently serving life without parole.\n",
      "These cases involved “heinous, heinous” crimes, Ms. Cooper said.\n",
      "Young people convicted of murder should be justly punished, but Michigan’s approach isn’t close to what the Supreme Court envisioned.\n",
      "The point made in the court’s rulings is that young people are biologically and psychologically different from adults.\n",
      "They are more impulsive and more prone to change as their brains continue to develop.\n",
      "When it comes to driving, voting and buying alcohol, society recognizes these realities; so should the criminal justice system.\n",
      "Some states are changing their laws to reflect this understanding of juvenile development.\n",
      "In the last five years, 12 states — including Texas, Nevada, Wyoming and West Virginia — have banned life-without-parole sentences for juveniles in all cases, for a total of 17, according to a new report from the Campaign for the Fair Sentencing of Youth.\n",
      "Four states ban the sentence in nearly all cases, and three others have never imposed such a sentence.\n",
      "In many cases, even the prosecutors believed that more lenient terms were appropriate.\n",
      "In Wayne County, for instance, nearly one-third of those serving life without parole were initially offered plea deals that averaged 20 years.\n",
      "One defendant now serving life rejected a plea offer of four years behind bars.\n",
      "It’s not just defense lawyers and children’s advocates criticizing this trend in Michigan.\n",
      "Former Gov.\n",
      "William Milliken, a Republican, has called for an outright ban on life without parole for juveniles.\n",
      "And a former Wayne County prosecutor, John O’Hair, who was responsible for putting away more than 90 of the inmates currently serving that sentence, has said that in light of the Supreme Court’s rulings, “it’s hard to imagine that a prosecutor would blithely seek life sentences again”.\n",
      "Now it is up to federal judges to force Michigan’s misbehaving prosecutors to follow the law.\n",

      "Ray Allen won N.B.A. championships in Boston and Miami, made one of the most memorable shots in N.B.A. finals history and has more 3-pointers than anyone else who played in the league.\n",
      "More than two years after his last game, he has decided that was enough.\n",
      "Allen announced his retirement Tuesday in a post on The Players' Tribune website.\n",
      "Allen spent 18 seasons in the league with Milwaukee, Seattle, the Celtics and the Heat, averaging 18.9 points in 1,300 career regular-season games and appearing in 10 All-Star Games.\n",
      "''I write this to you today as a 41-year-old man who is retiring from the game,'' Allen said in his post, which was in the form of a letter to his younger self.\n",
      "''I write to you as a man who is completely at peace with himself.''\n",
      "Allen entertained thoughts about a comeback over the last two years and had plenty of opportunities from title-contending teams.\n",
      "But nothing ever lured him back, although the door always remained a tiny bit open -- until now.\n",
      "''Basketball will take you far away from that school yard,'' Allen wrote.\n",
      "''You will become far more than just a basketball player.\n",
      "You'll get to act in movies.\n",
      "You'll travel the world.\n",
      "You will become a husband, and the father of five amazing children.''\n",
      "Allen starred in the 1998 Spike Lee film ''He Got Game,'' portraying Jesus Shuttlesworth, a top-ranked basketball prospect whose father (played by Denzel Washington) is in prison for killing his wife.\n",
      "On the court, teammates and coaches raved about Allen's famed work ethic and commitment to fitness -- which now takes a different form, after he and his wife, Shannon, recently opened an organic fast-casual restaurant in Miami.\n",
      "Allen was almost always on the floor for a workout three hours before games, shooting on some occasions before the arena lights were even turned on.\n",
      "Allen had the record for 3-pointers in a season for seven years, his mark of 269 standing until Stephen Curry of Golden State made 272 in 2012-13 -- a record Curry has topped twice.\n",
      "In all, Allen made 2,973 3-pointers in regular-season games, which does not even count the one that was his most unforgettable.\n",
      "His 3-pointer from the right corner with 5.2 seconds left in Game 6 of the 2013 N.B.A. finals for Miami sent the Heat to overtime against the Spurs in a win-or-else game, and helped them go on to win the title in seven games.\n",
      "Chris Bosh got an offensive rebound and passed to Allen, who was backtracking toward the corner.\n",
      "Allen, without even needing to look down to ensure that he was behind the line, elevated over Tony Parker and connected to tie the game -- even as arena workers knelt around the court, holding the rope that they presumed they would soon be called upon to cordon things off for the Spurs' championship celebration.\n",
      "On his way back to the bench to prepare for overtime, Allen gestured to those workers, shouting to put the rope away.\n",
      "''It's going to be a shot that I'm going to remember for a long time,'' Allen said that night.\n",

      "I brush my teeth twice a day, but not for as long as my dentist would like.\n",
      "I'd like to say I floss regularly, but that would be stretching the truth.\n",
      "I don't scrape my tongue, I don't rinse with mouthwash and I don't use an interdental brush or Waterpik.\n",
      "However, I have one filling in my mouth, and I got that only when I had braces as an adult 15 years ago.\n",
      "My wife, on the other hand, cares for her teeth fastidiously.\n",
      "She does all the things you're supposed to do, and then some.\n",
      "But she has more fillings than I can count.\n",
      "I remember once, years ago, when one of her teeth broke while she was eating scrambled eggs.\n",
      "Clearly, the stuff we're doing might not make as much of a difference as we think.\n",
      "A couple of weeks ago, many of you were shocked to learn that the evidence supporting flossing daily was as thin as, well, dental floss.\n",
      "That's just the beginning.\n",
      "As my colleague Austin Frakt pointed out recently, for adults without apparent dental problems, there's little evidence to support the use of yearly dental X-rays.\n",
      "This still doesn't prevent many dentists from recommending them for everyone.\n",
      "With respect to flossing, this shouldn't have been news either.\n",
      "A systematic review in 2011 concluded that, in adults, toothbrushing with flossing versus toothbrushing alone most likely reduced gingivitis, or inflammation of the gums.\n",
      "But there was really weak evidence that it reduced plaque in the short term.\n",
      "There was no evidence that it reduced cavities.\n",
      "That's pretty much what we learned recently.\n",
      "What about everything else?\n",
      "It turns out there's a whole journal dedicated to the idea that we could use more rigor in dental recommendations.\n",
      "Evidence-Based Dentistry either publishes systematic reviews or summarizes reviews from other organizations, like the Cochrane Collaboration.\n",
      "The good news is that brushing appears to work.\n",
      "But it's important to know that it's brushing with fluoride toothpaste that matters, not the brushing alone.\n",
      "Doing that doesn't just prevent gingivitis and plaque formation; it also prevents cavities, which is the outcome that we care most about.\n",
      "My dentist has always recommended a powered toothbrush.\n",
      "The evidence seems to agree that, as many randomized controlled trials confirm, powered toothbrushes reduce both plaque and gingivitis more than regular toothbrushes.\n",
      "An older Cochrane review concluded that the rotating powered toothbrushes were superior than the side to side powered brushes.\n",
      "I use the latter, and this disappointed me.\n",
      "But the difference between the two types, while statistically significant, was really small.\n",
      "There appear to be no good randomized controlled trials on brushing frequency.\n",
      "The other studies that do exist, while flawed, seem to support twice-a-day brushing.\n",
      "Surely the twice-a-year teeth cleanings matter?\n",
      "In 2005, Evidence-Based Dentistry highlighted a systematic review on the effects of routine scaling and polishing (you call it teeth cleaning).\n",
      "Researchers found eight randomized controlled trials that were on point, but they were all judged as having a high risk of bias.\n",
      "The results were all over the map.\n",
      "Their conclusions were that the evidence isn't of sufficient quality to reach any conclusions as to the benefits or harms of scaling and polishing.\n",
      "Regardless, I've been told by all the dentists I know to have it done every six months.\n",
      "When filling cavities, some dentists advocate bonded amalgams over non-bonded amalgams.\n",
      "There's pretty much no evidence to support that practice, though.\n",
      "The one randomized controlled trial didn't seem to support their use, especially since they cost much more.\n",
      "Previous, nonrandomized controlled trials in children didn't really show a difference either.\n",
      "Has anyone ever told you to use an interdental brush to get at the plaque between your teeth?\n",
      "In 2015, Evidence-Based Dentistry summarized a Cochrane Review of seven randomized controlled trials looking at how interdental brushing in addition to tooth brushing compared with toothbrushing alone or toothbrushing with flossing.\n",
      "Almost no long-term benefits have been proven.\n",
      "What about preventive dental visits themselves?\n",
      "In 2013, Bisakha Sen, Nir Menachemi and colleagues used data from the Alabama Children's Health Insurance Program to follow more than 36,000 children to see how preventive dental visits affected dental care and spending over time.\n",
      "They found that preventive visits were associated with fewer visits for restorative dental care in the future, implying that there was an improvement in oral health.\n",
      "But they found that, for the most part, more than one annual preventive visit in children was not cost-effective.\n",
      "Further work found that it may have been the use of sealants, and not preventive visits in general, that had this protective effect.\n",
      "Since sealants could be applied without an actual visit to the dentist, that brings into question whether a more cost-effective means of getting sealant on children's teeth might be possible -- using a lower-cost dental hygienist, perhaps.\n",
      "Fluoride varnish appears to work well, too.\n",
      "No review of dental health would be complete without at least acknowledging water fluoridation.\n",
      "Much of the evidence is old because it's getting hard to do studies.\n",
      "It would be somewhat unethical to withhold fluoridation at this point from some people, because the evidence in favor of the practice is so compelling.\n",
      "In fact, fluoride is so important that the  U.S. Preventive Services Task Force recommends that in areas where the water supply is deficient, providers prescribe oral fluoride supplementation to children.\n",
      "They recommend the use of fluoride varnish as well.\n",
      "To recap, there's good evidence that brushing twice a day with fluoride toothpaste is a good idea, especially with a powered toothbrush.\n",
      "For children, there's good evidence that the use of fluoride varnish or sealants can be a powerful tool to prevent cavities.\n",
      "The rest?\n",
      "It's debatable.\n",
      "I should note that the lack of evidence doesn't mean that many of these things don't work.\n",
      "It just means that we don't have good studies to back their use.\n",
      "In that case, we must weigh the potential harms against the unproven benefits.\n",
      "With flossing, which is cheap and easy, it still might be worth doing.\n",
      "With scaling and polishing, as well as preventive visits, which are expensive and can hurt, it's more questionable.\n",
      "We should also recognize that there are a lot of things outside of our control.\n",
      "Some are genetic.\n",
      "The strength of our enamel most likely determines how easily bacteria can break through defenses.\n",
      "Salivary flow and composition help determine how easily we can clear dangerous bugs.\n",
      "Tooth morphology can leave some teeth more susceptible to infection.\n",
      "Other things have little to do with dentistry.\n",
      "What you eat can affect your dental health.\n",
      "More important may be mother-to-child transmission of bacteria.\n",
      "Children aren't born with mouthfuls of germs.\n",
      "Studies show that cavity-causing bacteria get passed directly by parents (mostly mothers) to children, probably by sharing silverware or by other mouth-to-mouth transmission.\n",
      "There's a reason that mothers with lots of cavities sometimes have children who suffer the same.\n",
      "There are things we can do to prevent cavities and preserve our oral health.\n",
      "We should focus on those things.\n",
      "We should study the things we debate.\n",

      "''Rather than owning ships, we're evaluating whether we want to move into ship lending, where banks have been retreating,'' said Mr. Schiff, the firm's chief executive, in a phone interview.\n",
      "Mr. Dym is the president.\n",
      "The firm will seek assets that have a steady cash flow and can withstand volatile environments, and it plans to improve the businesses as well.\n",
      "The strategy is similar the one Mr. Schiff and Mr. Dym used at Perella Weinberg, where they were members of that firm's asset-based value strategy fund.\n",
      "Last year, the two filed a lawsuit against Perella Weinberg seeking reassurance they would not have to forfeit pay for starting their own firm.\n",
      "They settled with their employer about a year ago, according to a statement released by Perella Weinberg in October.\n",
      "The agreement allowed their asset-based value team to be separated into a new firm, which would become a subadviser to Perella Weinberg's existing funds.\n",
      "Innovatus's $1.9 billion in assets under management includes the legacy assets from Mr. Schiff and Mr. Dym's tenure at Perella Weinberg.\n",
      "The firm is also expected to announce that Israel A. Englander, the chairman and chief executive of Millennium Management, a behemoth hedge fund with $34 billion in assets, is joining the advisory board of Innovatus and will serve as a strategic adviser.\n",
      "''We feel very fortunate that Izzy chose to partner with Innovatus,'' Mr. Schiff said.\n",
      "''His involvement is a testament to the platform we're building.''\n",
      "Innovatus has 10 employees and offices in Midtown Manhattan.\n",
      "The firm announced that Andrew Hobson, former chief financial officer at Univision Communications, would hold the same role at Innovatus.\n",
      "Joseph Schottland also has joined as a partner and head of research.\n",
      "He was formerly a partner at McKinsey & Company.\n",

      "The flow of tourists into New York, which has helped fuel the city's growth and stabilize its economy during the recession,  fell off in 2009, according to various indicators used by the city.\n",
      "The decrease,  which would be the industry's first annual decline in eight years, could be seen at the area's three major airports and at Pennsylvania Station, where traffic was down, even counting the mob that gathered for New Year's Eve festivities in Midtown.\n",
      "It also has affected hotels and Broadway theaters, where more rooms and seats went unsold.\n",
      "Officials have not released the city's  official year-end figures, but as recently as last summer, they had been predicting a 4.5 percent decline in visitors.\n",
      "And in analyzing the data used by the city in calculating tourism numbers, all of the crucial indicators have declined.\n",
      "At the area's three major airports, for example, the number of passengers was on pace to fall to roughly 100 million for the first time since 2005, preliminary data show.\n",
      "Attendance at Broadway shows for the current season was down 5.2 percent, and the number of delegates attending trade shows at the Jacob K. Javits Convention Center was off by about 30 percent through the first nine months of the year.\n",
      "As recently as the summer of 2008, the hordes of tourists had been growing so steadily that Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg moved up a self-imposed deadline for his goal of having the city draw 50 million visitors a year.\n",
      "He originally said that total could be reached by 2015, then accelerated the plan to 2013.\n",
      "But the recession has interrupted the mayor's vision, as businesses large and small have felt the effects of the tourism decline in 2009.\n",
      "At Souvenirs on 5th, a gift shop on West 34th Street, Carlos Flores had time to rearrange merchandise just 12 hours before the crystal ball was to begin its descent toward the throng in Times Square.\n",
      "The store was fully stocked with all manner of T-shirts, key chains and other keepsakes expressing a global fondness for the city and, especially, its police force and firefighters.\n",
      "But few were selling -- for the posted $15 or even at a haggler's discount.\n",
      "''My boss is really suffering,'' lamented Mr. Flores, who said he lived in Astoria, Queens, and had been selling souvenirs in the city for 10 years.\n",
      "''We used to work here, like, 10 guys, now it's just 3  people.\n",
      "This time of year, we used to work 24/7.\n",
      "Now there's no people.\n",
      "They're not spending money.''\n",
      "Mr. Flores said a rise in the number of American customers had offset some of the decline in European shoppers, but not nearly enough.\n",
      "City officials have been reluctant to cast  the city's tourism numbers in a negative light, and loath to suggest that the mayor's goal might not be met.\n",
      "Officials had been forecasting a decline in visitors to about 45 million for the year.\n",
      "That would represent a drop of about 2 million from the 47 million visitors the city estimated for 2008.\n",
      "But Christopher C. Heywood, a spokesman for NYC & Company, the city's tourism marketing arm, declined to say on Thursday whether the final estimate for 2009 would be that low.\n",
      "Tourism officials said the drop-off had been less severe than they had feared after the financial crisis set off a global recession.\n",
      "The weakness of the American dollar, caused in part by the Federal Reserve's efforts to stimulate the economy with historically low interest rates, has helped lure budget travelers from overseas.\n",
      "''We're in a very different place than we were a year ago, but I wouldn't call it a turnaround yet,'' said Emily K. Rafferty, the president of the Metropolitan Museum of Art and the chairwoman of NYC & Company.\n",
      "''I'm certainly cautious about saying we've reached a turning point.\n",
      "What I am comfortable saying is that, if anything, things have stabilized to some extent.''\n",
      "In 2009, some measures of tourist activity have dropped more sharply.\n",
      "Through the first 10 months of the year, the number of passengers using the region's airports had dropped by almost 6 percent, to 85.6 million, according to data from the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey.\n",
      "At that pace, the total for the year would be below 101 million for the first time in four years.\n",
      "The number of passengers peaked at 110 million in 2007.\n",
      "The effect on the city's hotels has been even more pronounced.\n",
      "Through November, the occupancy rate for hotels in Manhattan was 80.6 percent, down from 85.5 percent in the same period of 2008, according to John A. Fox, a senior vice president at PKF Consulting in New York.\n",
      "Many more rooms surely would have gone empty if  hotels had not slashed their rates.\n",
      "The average rate paid for Manhattan hotel rooms in 2009 was $220, about $70 lower than the previous year, according to PKF.\n",
      "''New York City hotels have substantially recovered occupancy -- but not room rates -- from the very significant downturns that started in the fall of 2008,'' Mr. Fox said.\n",
      "In October and November, the city's hotels sold more rooms than they had in the same months of 2008, though still at significantly lower rates, he added.\n",
      "''I guess I would term it cautiously optimistic that we have hit bottom,'' Mr. Fox said.\n",
      "But he noted that the city is still adding a large number of hotel rooms, which will make it difficult to increase occupancy or rates quickly.\n",
      "Mr. Fox said the hotel industry slump would have been worse but for the weakness of the dollar and the aggressive promotional efforts of NYC & Company, which has placed ads and marketing agents around the world.\n",
      "Ms. Rafferty said the city's hotels, restaurants, theaters and attractions had worked together to lure visitors with discounts and packages.\n",
      "She said that while attendance at the Met had fallen,  it had exceeded expectations in 2009, in part because about one-third of its visitors were from other countries.\n",
      "She said her counterparts at other museums in the city had reported similar results.\n",
      "Ms. Rafferty also hinted that despite the recession, the final numbers recorded for 2009 might not be far below the 2008 total, or far off pace to reach the mayor's goal on schedule.\n",
      "''I would say we're pleased, thrilled by 2009,'' she said.\n",
      "''We go into 2010 thinking it was a job well done.''\n",

      "Against a backdrop of recent shootings of bystanders, including a 13-year-old boy from Queens and a 15-year-old girl from the Bronx, city officials and members of a civil rights group took action against gun violence on Monday, albeit in different ways and at different events.\n",

      "The speakers included Donna Greaves, the mother of the 13-year-old Queens boy, Kevin Miller, who was shot to death as he walked to a McDonald's last month.\n",
      "In the Brooklyn case announced on Monday, Mr. Bloomberg -- joined by the Brooklyn district attorney, Charles J. Hynes, and Police Commissioner Raymond W. Kelly -- said that for three months this summer, two men sold dozens of guns to undercover officers from an apartment in East New York.\n",
      "Officials said the guns, most of them bought at pawn shops and gun shows in Florida, were worth more than $40,000.\n",
      "Mr. Kelly called one of the men, Ryan Woodard, 22, ''a full-service dealer,'' who sold guns at a huge markup, including some that were loaded.\n",
      "Mr. Woodard and another man, Watson Joachin, 27, sold 40 guns to undercover officers, the authorities said.\n",
      "Mr. Hynes called for stiffer penalties against those convicted of selling or possessing firearms that had been brought in from out of state, suggesting that they should receive 25 years in prison, rather than 15 years.\n",
      "Mr. Bloomberg also fielded questions about the prospect of terrorism trials in New York, and he dismissed the idea that they would pose a security threat.\n",

      "There is no single replacement for Oprah Winfrey.\n",
      "That is not necessarily a statement about the dominance of her 23-year-old television institution, ''The Oprah Winfrey Show.''\n",
      "Rather, it is the reality of television syndication.\n",
      "As Ms. Winfrey prepares to leave the broadcast airwaves in two years, a stable of talk shows are in competition to fill her time slot on more than 200 stations across the country.\n",
      "Individual stations are bound to place differing bets, drastically reshaping the daytime TV landscape.\n",
      "As with NBC and Jay Leno earlier this year, the television chess board is being rearranged by a talk show host.\n",
      "Ms. Winfrey's departure could even affect the ratings for the network evening newscasts.\n",
      "''All of a sudden, there are so many moving pieces,'' Bill Carroll, who recommends syndicated shows to stations for the Katz Television Group, said on Friday.\n",
      "Even before Ms. Winfrey announced on Friday that 2011 would be, as she put it, the ''exact right time'' to step off her broadcast stage, TV executives were jostling on behalf of Ellen DeGeneres, Dr. Mehmet Oz, Phil McGraw and other hosts who aim to benefit from the syndication shake-up.\n",
      "Analysts say that Ms. DeGeneres and Dr. Oz, in particular, stand to gain, because their deals with stations will come up for renewal at the same time that Ms. Winfrey intends to depart.\n",
      "Aspiring hosts could emerge as well.\n",
      "''I'm sure there are a number of people calling their agents today and saying, 'I think I could be the next Oprah,' '' Mr. Carroll said.\n",
      "No matter what, it seems, Ms. Winfrey comes out a winner in syndication.\n",
      "Already, she has groomed another decade's worth of new talk show hosts.\n",
      "She ordained Mr. McGraw in 2002, and his talk show, ''Dr. Phil,'' now ranks second behind her own hour.\n",
      "She followed up with ''Rachael Ray'' in 2006 and ''The Dr. Oz Show'' this fall.\n",
      "''Dr. Oz'' is already a hit.\n",
      "And now she is developing a program for Nate Berkus, her favorite interior designer, for fall 2010.\n",
      "Already, executives at Ms. Winfrey's distributor, CBS, and at its competitors are thinking about how to fill the Oprah void -- and how to capture new market share when she exits.\n",
      "Mr. Carroll said the industry would be carefully watching the scheduling decisions of the stations owned and operated by ABC that carry Ms. Winfrey in most of the country's biggest TV markets, usually in the 4 p.m. hour.\n",
      "Ms. Winfrey, whose program has averaged 6.8 million viewers this season, guides many of those viewers to the station's local newscasts.\n",
      "Closely watching, as well, will be evening news anchors like Katie Couric.\n",
      "''World News'' on ABC, to be anchored by Diane Sawyer beginning in January, has historically been given a lift by ''Oprah,'' analysts say, to the detriment of the third-place ''CBS Evening News'' with Ms. Couric.\n",
      "''Look at what happens in sports when a dynasty gets broken up.\n",
      "It opens up the playing field for everyone else,'' said a senior executive at a distributor who, like other television executives interviewed for this article, requested anonymity because programming negotiations normally take place in private.\n",
      "The playing field is shrinking, however.\n",
      "Fewer viewers are watching daytime talk shows than a decade ago, mirroring the broader audience shift from broadcast television to cable and making it more difficult for stations to afford the expensive license fees that CBS charges for Ms. Winfrey's show.\n",
      "Analysts say the prospect of lower license fees in the future contributed to Ms. Winfrey's decision to move to cable.\n",
      "(Her production company, Harpo, is a co-owner in OWN: The Oprah Winfrey Network, which is expected to make its debut in January 2011.\n",
      "After ''The Oprah Winfrey Show'' ends in September of that year, she will ''participate in new programming'' for OWN, Harpo said in a statement on Friday.\n",
      ")  In the syndication structure, stations try to recoup the licensing fee by selling advertising time, about 11 minutes worth during ''The Oprah Winfrey Show.''\n",
      "But for many stations, ''Oprah'' is so expensive that it is a loss leader.\n",
      "Ms. Winfrey's daytime talk show will be missed, Emily Barr, the president and general manager at WLS-TV in Chicago, told The Associated Press, ''but we will also move on and see what else is out there.''\n",
      "ABC's station group could fill the ''Oprah'' void with local newscasts or develop its own talk show.\n",
      "''Those are the only ways to control costs going forward,'' Mr. Carroll said.\n",
      "ABC executives have also talked in the past about moving ''The View,'' which the network owns, to the late afternoon.\n",
      "What about Ms. Winfrey's other stations?\n",
      "Syndication executives expect ''The Ellen DeGeneres Show,'' which is distributed by Warner Brothers and is licensed to NBC-owned stations until 2011, to increase its audience share.\n",
      "Currently, ''Ellen is more for entertainment and Oprah is more for information,'' said Joel Berman, a former president of worldwide TV distribution for CBS Paramount.\n",
      "Citing Ms. Winfrey's star booking power, he said ''Ellen will be a natural venue for these big celebrity guests to go.''\n",
      "The two women have become closer over the years, promoting speculation that Ms. Winfrey was somehow anointing Ms. DeGeneres as a successor.\n",
      "The two women share the cover of O, The Oprah Magazine this month.\n",
      "Ms. Winfrey ''will always be the queen of daytime television,'' Ms. DeGeneres told her audience after taping her talk show on Thursday -- ''and she also said she is leaving me all of her money,'' she jokingly added.\n",
      "''The Dr. Oz Show,'' which had its premiere in September, largely on Fox stations, could also benefit.\n",
      "Out of the gate, it has averaged 3.5 million viewers in daytime, only 250,000 fewer than ''Dr. Phil.''\n",
      "Two weeks ago, CBS extended its station deals for ''Dr. Phil'' through 2014 in 20 of the country's top 25 markets.\n",
      "The contracts for ''Dr. Oz'' and ''Dr. Phil'' forbid them from being shown at the same hour as Ms. Winfrey -- but those restrictions end when her talk show ends.\n",
      "The shake-up may also make more room for lower-rated talk shows by Martha Stewart, Tyra Banks and Bonnie Hunt, among others.\n",
      "Looking farther afield, Ms. Couric, whose CBS News contract is up in 2011, has long been mentioned as a possible syndicated star.\n",
      "And of course, the competitive landscape two years from now may also include Ms. Winfrey herself.\n",
      "Stations will be watching to see what the OWN channel shows at 4 p.m.  ''Will anyone equal the ratings Oprah had done in the past, or even what she's doing today?\n",
      "If I were going to make an educated guess, I would say no,'' Mr. Carroll said.\n",
      "''Will there be a program leader in the new environment?\n",
      "Yes.\n",
      "Who that will be, only the viewers know.''\n",

      "ONE of the more intriguing cultural phenomena of the last decade was the wristwatch renaissance.\n",
      "Startlingly defiant in the face of cheaper-than-dirt digital technology that ran circles around even the most advanced watch works, men's watches grew in size, price and stature in what seemed to be proportions similar to real estate.\n",
      "They inched toward 50 millimeters in diameter; they flaunted diamond bezels, tourbillion movements and complications galore; and they regularly cost $15,000 to $50,000.\n",
      "So it hardly came as a surprise when sales of the deluxe beauties -- tokens of the Wall Street bonus culture -- stalled at the end of 2008 and have only begun to tiptoe back to life.\n",
      "What is surprising is how strong sales have been for watches that are less expensive and less flashy (but which can hardly be described as cheap or low-key).\n",
      "''November was our biggest month ever,'' said Stacie Orloff, the president of Bell & Ross North America, known for watches that resemble vintage military gauges.\n",
      "November's sales, she said, were up 25 percent over November 2008 and 18 percent over 2007.\n",
      "''Men are shopping for watches a lot more impulsively than you might expect,'' said Tom Kalenderian, the men's fashion director at Barneys New York.\n",
      "''Accessories are the simplest and fastest way to express your individuality, and for these guys a watch can do that in a way a business suit can't.''\n",
      "And, he said, watch collecting is appealing to younger and younger men; Barneys has even begun a program of wristwatch trunk shows to introduce men to new lines and hard-to-find models.\n",
      "What makes one watch a hit and another a miss is hard to pin down.\n",
      "But watch-watchers comment that models that are in equal measure sporty, classic and flashy, like the new Rolex Air-King with aggressive orange numbers, do just that.\n",
      "''Men are buying watches that aren't ostentatious but that do have a fresh new look,'' said Ruediger Albers, the president of Wempe.\n",
      "''I'd say the average price right now is about $5,000, so it's easy to explain to the neighbors.''\n",
      "Even watches that cost as much as $6,000, like TAG Heuer's new special-edition Monaco automatic chronograph, manage to walk the fine line between yesterday and tomorrow to be a hot ticket today.\n",
      "Sadly, no matter the price, no watch has a special ''complication'' that will tell you when you'll decide you want yet another watch.\n",
      "But like everything in life, that moment will most likely come too soon.\n",

      "Girardi is under contract for only one more year, but after the Yankees' triumph over the Philadelphia Phillies last month, he will probably be around much longer.\n",
      "More pressing now, he said, is building the 2010 team, a task in which he is actively involved.\n",
      "Girardi, who said he speaks twice a day with General Manager Brian Cashman, will attend organizational meetings Thursday and Friday in Tampa, Fla.\n",
      "The Yankees will decide on their payroll there before the winter meetings start Monday in Indianapolis.\n",
      "Last winter, Girardi spoke with C. C. Sabathia and A. J. Burnett while the Yankees recruited them.\n",

      "''I got the sense at the end of the season that he wasn't done, but sometimes you go home, you talk about things with your family,'' Girardi said.\n",
      "''I'm sure he'll prepare like he's going to pitch.''\n",
      "The Yankees are also monitoring the market for the Toronto ace Roy Halladay, knowing that the Blue Jays could trade him and that Boston would be interested.\n",
      "It is too early to know the specific cost in players or money.\n",
      "''We don't know if he's going to be moved or not, but he's pretty good,'' Girardi said.\n",
      "''If he is moved, whoever he goes to, he's going to be extremely beneficial.\n",
      "He could make a significant impact.''\n",
      "The major free agents in the Yankees' lineup, Johnny Damon and Hideki Matsui, combined for 52 home runs and 172 runs batted in last season.\n",
      "But Damon turned 36 last month, and Matsui turns 36 in June.\n",

      "Excluding food and energy prices, which tend to be volatile, the increase was steady at 0.1 percent in December.\n",

      "''It's going to stay quiet.''\n",
      "Consumer prices were higher in December, partly because of a 2.5 percent increase in the cost of used cars and trucks, which economists attributed to a dwindling supply of used cars.\n",

      "A separate report by the Federal Reserve on Friday showed that capacity utilization -- a measure of how much of the nation's production capability is in use -- reached 72 percent in December, the highest level in a year.\n",
      "Yet that remained far below the historical average of 80.9.\n",
      "Over all, industrial production rose by a seasonally adjusted 0.6 percent, the Fed's report said, though that was driven largely by a surge in utility prices during a stretch of cold weather in December.\n",

      "SAVAGE LANDS  By Clare Clark  406 pp.\n",
      "Houghton Mifflin Harcourt.\n",
      "$25  A prominent historian once asked if I didn't get tired of the sort of research novelists often feel obliged to pursue.\n",
      "Must we really know how 19th-century Latvian lumberjacks brushed their teeth?\n",
      "Aren't you tempted to make things up?\n",
      "Coming from a historian, this sounded like heresy -- or perhaps the historian's dream vacation.\n",
      "''Of course I'm tempted,'' I said.\n",
      "''I fudge, I make things up, but I also pounce on arcana.''\n",
      "Moreover, to work under the constraints of historical fact can spur the imagination, just as working with rhyme and meter does for poets.\n",
      "Clare Clark's ''Savage Lands'' combines a well-researched historical context, many hogsheads full of period detail and a fictional story to make a novel that requires no spur to its imaginings.\n",
      "Rather, just the opposite.\n",
      "''Savage Lands'' tells the story of the first French colonists in Louisiana and their struggle to survive in a ruthless time and place.\n",
      "In 1704, 23 women are sent to the colony to marry men they've never met.\n",
      "One of them, Elisabeth Savaret, is Clark's heroine.\n",
      "To her credit, Clark does not sentimentalize the presumably intrepid character of the colony's pioneers.\n",
      "Most are either coarse and depressed (the women) or greedy, brutal and remorseless (the men), and the man Elisabeth marries, Jean-Claude Babelon, may be the worst of the lot.\n",
      "He's an equal opportunity scoundrel, duping his friends as well as his enemies and enslaving the local ''savages,'' including those friendly to the French.\n",
      "He even hatches a scheme to trade Indian slaves for Africans, pointing out that ''the Negro makes an altogether better slave.\n",
      "That is why I propose to offer three savages for every two of them.''\n",
      "Yet Elisabeth loves him with a passion Clark strives repeatedly to describe, in the process barely skirting the slippery slope to supermarket romance.\n",
      "''When he touched her,'' we learn, ''his lips and fingers exquisitely unhurried, every freckle, every tiny hair was his, each one charged and spangled with the light of him.''\n",
      "Under his influence, ''her skin eased and opened.\n",
      "Her muscles melted.\n",
      "Even her bones softened, so that she moved with the indolence of a sun-drunk cat.''\n",
      "The strongest character in the novel, Elisabeth is also the weakest when it comes to Jean-Claude, whom the book's jacket copy describes as ''charismatic.''\n",
      "Charisma, admittedly, is almost as difficult as virtue to depict in fiction.\n",
      "Clark's solution to this problem is to leave Jean-Claude's inner life alone.\n",
      "Of the novel's three main characters, Elisabeth and a young former cabin boy named Auguste are the more fully portrayed, and each comes under Jean-Claude's spell.\n",
      "He's the apex of their triangular desire -- or, more accurately, their vanishing point, but that isn't enough to make him real.\n",
      "In many respects, ''Savage Lands'' is a good old-fashioned (that is, slow and deliberate) 19th-century novel, with all the weight of material detail and all the unexpected turns of plot and shifts of time and place that we expect from such productions.\n",
      "The physical world of Louisiana, its bursting ripeness and rot, becomes a metaphor for the characters' inner lives, and this is undoubtedly where the novel's strength lies.\n",
      "Clark's descriptive prose contains some startling metaphors.\n",
      "In one passage, the night sky at dawn curls up at its edges, ''exposing the gray-pink linings of the day.''\n",
      "In another, a man's hand, extended for a handshake, swings ''as if the bolts that attached it to the wrist had worked loose.''\n",
      "But the descriptions mount, and too often they read as though they're on steroids: ''In the wilderness savages lurked in the shadows and the prodigious forest nosed and slid and crept and coiled upward without ceasing.\n",
      "The licentious suck of it rotted the roots of the trees and pushed blindly up through the decaying luxuriance of its half-digested self, an eruption of snaking coils and crude excrescences bursting from the thick black slime.\n",
      "Its fecundity was as grotesque as it was shameless.\n",
      "It throbbed in the ceaseless thrum of the cicadas, in the suck and gasp of the reed-choked bayou.\n",
      "It draped itself from the trees, smearing their trunks with velvet, hanging in gluttonous hanks from their branches and exploding into pale, fleshy mushrooms at their roots.\n",
      "There was no shape to the forest, no order.\n",
      "There was only ungovernable profusion, blotting out the light, gorging on the lush compost of the dead.''\n",
      "This leaves an indelible impression -- but it strains for effect, as does much of Clark's writing.\n",
      "Indeed, the straining is a part of its effect, describing not only a swamp but the author's language, its fecundity as grotesque as it is shameless.\n",
      "Throughout ''Savage Lands,'' the figurative language piles up like heavy jewelry, like layers of clothing, like armor, like.\n",
      ".\n",
      ".\n",
      ".\n",
      "You get the idea.\n",
      "It drags down the poor sentences forced to wear it.\n",

      "As expected, the four sculptures by Chakaia Booker in the garden at the Katonah Museum of Art provide the most stimulating experience of outdoor art in Westchester right now.\n",
      "Not only does Ms. Booker, 56, possess a natural eye for expressive forms, but her materials --  cast-off rubber tires from cars, trucks and tractors --  are manipulated with such  zeal as to suggest a vivid essay on  how to make art from unorthodox materials.\n",
      "The variety  of the pieces  further testifies to her command of sculptural techniques, control of detail and versatility as an outdoor sculpture specialist.\n",
      "Many artists have produced  excellent  outdoor public sculptures, but I can think of only a few who  have been as successful -- and over such a long period of time -- as Ms. Booker.\n",
      "Part of that   success comes from the material she uses, which  is ideally suited to art in an outdoor environment.\n",
      "Ms. Booker is often characterized as an abstract sculptor.\n",
      "But she is more.\n",
      "Her distinctive, powerfully convulsive forms often remind you of something organic -- possibly human, floral or even marine.\n",
      "Take ''Gridlock'' (2008), a pair of twisted vertical forms, concave on one side and feathered with hundreds of triangular shards of cut tire on the other, convex side.\n",
      "They  look like a discarded snake skin or the unwound strands of a DNA helix.\n",
      "Whatever their meaning or original inspiration, the strength of the forms lies in contrasting textures.\n",
      "The forthrightness of the razor-sharp exterior feathers  seems to caution us  ''to remain at a safe distance,'' as Lowery Stokes Sims writes in the show's catalog,  while the finely woven, skinlike surface on the concave sides seems to invite us  to inspect how the sculptures were made.\n",
      "From any distance, though, it is remarkable to think that such elegant objects were  made from a bunch of old tires.\n",
      "''Cross Over Effects'' (2003), the earliest piece here, is probably the most physically and visually satisfying -- partly  because the artist's decisions on balance, scale and style look and feel most persuasive, and partly because it is the only work in the exhibition in which Ms. Booker takes advantage of the decorative potential of the tire treads.\n",
      "Abundant, looping slivers of tire    protrude from a base of elaborately cut tire ''feathers'' resting atop a pole-like base.\n",
      "''Take Out'' and ''Pass the Buck,''  the other sculptures, are from 2008.\n",
      "Like ''Gridlock,''  they reveal the growing importance of structural armatures in Ms. Booker's most recent work, for in contrast to her earlier works, in which the shapes evolved organically, the new pieces consist of a preconceived frame onto which the artist has attached her tire shards.\n",
      "The earlier work has more emotion and a real rawness, but the preconstructed frames allow Ms. Booker to explore a far greater range and complexity of sculptural shapes.\n",
      "''Take Out,''  for instance, consists of a photo-frame shape decorated with a profusion of sprouting tendrils and other swirling, looplike shapes.\n",
      "It is a lot of fun, even though to my eye it is not installed to its best advantage in the garden, set against a tangle of trees, for the shape  creates a perfect picture window through which to view the world.\n",
      "It would look a lot better framing the view from a beach house in the Hamptons, or looking out over a leafy Westchester estate.\n",
      "''Pass the Buck'' is an unusual work for several reasons.\n",
      "First,  there is the basic design, consisting of a tight ball of interlocking circular elements.\n",
      "Then there is its bland surface quality, a uniform skin of flattened, interwoven pieces of rubber, instead of the more familiar feathers or expressive  tendrils that tend to characterize the artist's greatest achievements.\n",
      "This work looks by contrast almost aerodynamic, like a piece of streamlined designer furniture.\n",
      "What it does not look like is a sculpture made out of tires, which, for me, lessens its appeal.\n",
      "Still, the artist has put the material together with greater subtlety and fewer awkward joins.\n",
      "It also has its own special, sensitive mood of sturdy reverie, as opposed to the monumental power of the larger, more elaborate pieces.\n",
      "Even though I am not sure I like this sleeker, less ornate work, I sense and respect the experimental moment it embodies and  look forward to seeing more.\n",

      "''We're different than Marshalls or Syms or even Century 21,'' he told me later by phone.\n",

      "The store was full of funky New York City girls who understand that the queasily garish clothing of our embarrassing past can be reinterpreted and made retro-cool with the right earrings, confidence and sense of irony.\n",
      "I had one of these girls with me -- my friend Cary -- who ran through the store, scooping up halter tops, a pair of pre-faded Daisy Dukes and a miniskirt the color of orange sherbet, costing a total of $30.\n",
      "In a dressing room at the back of the store, Cary slipped on a sundress, but the zipper broke.\n",
      "She also tried a pair of Miss Sixty cords, rust-colored and extremely low-slung, but she resembled Christina Aguilera on the cover of ''Stripped,'' and it's too early to bring back that trend.\n",

      "CORRECTION APPENDED  Natasha Richardson, a Tony Award-winning actress whose career melded glamorous celebrity with the bloodline of theater royalty, died Wednesday at Lenox Hill Hospital in Manhattan.\n",
      "She had suffered head injuries in a skiing accident Monday north of Montreal, and was flown to New York on Tuesday.\n",
      "She was 45 and lived in Manhattan and in Millbrook, N.Y.  Alan Nierob, a spokesman for her husband, the actor Liam Neeson, announced Ms. Richardson's death Wednesday night.\n",
      "''Liam Neeson, his sons, and the entire family are shocked and devastated by the tragic death of their beloved Natasha,'' a statement said.\n",
      "''They are profoundly grateful for the support, love and prayers of everyone, and ask for privacy during this very difficult time.''\n",
      "The statement did not disclose the cause of death or discuss Ms. Richardson's medical condition.\n",
      "The gravity of her injuries had prompted an outpouring of public interest and concern and flurries of rumor and speculation since Monday, when reports of her accident began filtering out of the Mont Tremblant ski resort in the Laurentian hills.\n",
      "Ms. Richardson, who was not wearing a helmet, had fallen during a beginner's skiing lesson, a resort spokeswoman, Lyne Lortie, said Tuesday.\n",
      "''It was a normal fall; she didn't hit anyone or anything,'' Ms. Lortie said.\n",
      "''She didn't show any signs of injury.\n",
      "She was talking and she seemed all right.''\n",
      "Still, an instructor and a ski patrol member accompanied her off the slopes, and when Ms. Richardson complained of a headache about an hour later in her hotel, she was taken by ambulance to a hospital nearby and later transferred to one in Montreal.\n",
      "She was flown to Lenox Hill on Tuesday afternoon.\n",
      "On Wednesday, as television news vans stood outside, friends including Lauren Bacall and family members including Ms. Richardson's mother, Vanessa Redgrave, and sister, the actress Joely Richardson, were observed arriving.\n",
      "Mr. Neeson was seen crouched beside her in an ambulance in Montreal the day before.\n",
      "The news media attention harked back to the early 1990s, when the couple's relationship was noted in newspapers.\n",
      "She was a blond, beautiful English actress, he was her ruggedly handsome Irish co-star, and the two were thought to be courting right on stage, during a New York production.\n",
      "Ms. Richardson was an intense and absorbing actress who was unafraid of taking on demanding and emotionally raw roles.\n",
      "Classically trained, she was admired on both sides of the Atlantic for upholding the traditions of one of the great acting families of the modern age.\n",
      "Her grandfather was Sir Michael Redgrave, one of England's finest tragedians.\n",
      "He passed his gifts, if not always his affection, to his daughters, Vanessa and Lynn Redgrave, and his son, Corin Redgrave.\n",
      "The night Vanessa was born, her father was playing Laertes to Laurence Olivier's Hamlet.\n",
      "Ms. Richardson was the daughter of Vanessa Redgrave and the film director Tony Richardson, known for ''Tom Jones'' and ''The Loneliness of the Long-Distance Runner.''\n",
      "Married in the early 1960s, they were divorced in 1967.\n",
      "He died of AIDS in 1991 at the age of 63.\n",
      "Ms. Richardson came to critical prominence in England in 1985 as Nina, Chekhov's naive and vulnerable ingenue in ''The Seagull,'' a role her mother had played to great acclaim in 1964.\n",
      "It was a road production, and when it reached London, Vanessa Redgrave joined the cast as the narcissistic actress Arkadina.\n",
      "The production became legendary, but working with her mother intimidated her.\n",
      "''She rehearsed like a tornado,'' Ms. Richardson recalled in a 1993 interview with The New York Times Magazine.\n",
      "''It was completely crazy.\n",
      "She rolled on the floor in some scenes.\n",
      "I was terrified of being on stage with her.''\n",
      "But almost no one doubts that Ms. Redgrave inspired her daughter as well.\n",
      "Like her mother, Ms. Richardson was known for disappearing into a role, for not capitalizing on her looks and for being drawn to characters under duress.\n",
      "In the performance that made her a star in the United States, she played the title role on Broadway in a 1993 revival of ''Anna Christie,'' Eugene O'Neill's grueling portrait of a waterfront slattern in confrontation with the abusive men in her life.\n",
      "Embracing the emotional wreckage that showed in her character's face, she modeled her makeup each night on Edvard Munch's painting ''The Scream.''\n",
      "Her performance, nominated for a Tony Award, was vibrantly sensual, and her scenes with her co-star, Mr. Neeson, were acclaimed as sizzling and electric.\n",
      "The chemistry between them extended offstage as well; shortly after the run, Ms. Richardson separated from her husband, the producer Robert Fox.\n",
      "She and Mr. Neeson married in 1994.\n",
      "Besides her husband, Ms. Richardson is survived by their two sons, Micheal Richard Antonio Neeson, 13, and Daniel Jack Neeson, 12, as well as her mother, her sister, a half-sister, Katherine Grimond, and a half-brother, Carlo Sparanero, also known as Carlo Nero, the son of Ms. Redgrave and Franco Nero.\n",
      "Ms. Richardson's Tony Award came in 1998, for best actress in a musical, for her performance as Sally Bowles, the gifted but desperately needy singer in decadent Weimar Berlin who is at the center of ''Cabaret.''\n",
      "It was a remarkable award: Ms. Richardson's strengths did not include singing.\n",
      "But her reinvention of a role that was performed memorably by Jill Haworth in the 1966 Broadway production proved that a performer could act a song as well as sing it and make it equally affecting.\n",
      "''Ms. Richardson, you see, isn't selling the song; she's selling the character,'' Ben Brantley, writing in The Times, said of her delivery of the title song.\n",
      "''And as she forges ahead with the number, in a defiant, metallic voice, you can hear the promise of the lyrics tarnishing in Sally's mouth.\n",
      "She's willing herself to believe in them, and all too clearly losing the battle.''\n",
      "Natasha Jane Richardson was born in London on May 11, 1963.\n",
      "She made her first film appearance at the age of 4, playing a bridesmaid at the wedding of her mother's character in ''The Charge of the Light Brigade,'' directed by her father.\n",
      "She attended the Central School of Speech and Drama in London and got her first job in an outdoor production of ''A Midsummer Night's Dream.''\n",
      "She eventually moved to the United States, where ''no one cares about the Redgrave baggage,'' as she once said.\n",
      "She gave her greatest performances there.\n",
      "In the movies she played the title character in Paul Schrader's film ''Patty Hearst'' (1988), about the heiress and kidnap victim.\n",
      "She worked with Mr. Schrader again on ''The Comfort of Strangers'' (1990), a creepy psychological drama with a screenplay by Harold Pinter from a novel by Ian McEwan.\n",
      "The same year, she also starred in ''The Handmaid's Tale,'' an adaptation of the dystopian novel by Margaret Atwood about subjugated women in a pseudo-Christian theocracy.\n",
      "In a 1993 television adaptation of Tennessee Williams's one-act play ''Suddenly, Last Summer,'' she was Catherine Holly, a young woman (played by Elizabeth Taylor in the original movie) driven to the brink of insanity by the gruesome death of her young cousin.\n",
      "And she played the title role in the 1993 television movie ''Zelda,'' based on the life of Zelda Fitzgerald, F. Scott Fitzgerald's ferociously competitive and emotionally delicate wife.\n",
      "Ms. Richardson's more recent work has included more conventional Hollywood fare, including a remake of ''The Parent Trap'' (1998), the comedy ''Maid in Manhattan'' (2002) and the teenage melodrama ''Wild Child'' (2008).\n",
      "On stage, she appeared on Broadway in ''Closer,'' Patrick Marber's play about infidelity and the Internet, and as Blanche DuBois in a revival of ''A Streetcar Named Desire.''\n",
      "Though the production did not draw much praise, Ms. Richardson's performance did, as perhaps her grandfather had envisioned.\n",
      "In 1985, a week before he died, Sir Michael, enfeebled by Parkinson's disease, went to see Ms. Richardson as Ophelia in a production of ''Hamlet.''\n",

      "Footprints uncovered in Kenya show that as early as 1.5 million years ago an ancestral species, almost certainly Homo erectus, had already evolved the feet and walking gait of modern humans.\n",
      "An international team of scientists, in a report on Friday in the journal Science, said the well-defined prints in an eroding bluff east of Lake Turkana ''provided the oldest evidence of an essentially modern humanlike foot anatomy.''\n",
      "They said the find also added to evidence that painted a picture of Homo erectus as the prehumans who took long evolutionary strides -- figuratively and, now it seems, also literally.\n",
      "Where the individuals who made the tracks were going, or why, is beyond knowing by the cleverest scientist.\n",
      "The variability of the separation between some steps, researchers said, suggests that they were picking their way over an uneven surface, muddy enough to leave a mark -- an unintended message from an extinct species for the contemplation of its descendants.\n",
      "Until now, no footprint trails had ever been associated with early members of our long-legged genus Homo.\n",
      "Preserved ancient footprints of any kind are rare.\n",
      "The only earlier prints of a protohuman species were found in 1978 at Laetoli, in Tanzania.\n",
      "Dated at 3.7 million years ago, they were made by Australopithecus afarensis, the diminutive species to which the famous Lucy skeleton belonged.\n",
      "The prints showed that the species already walked upright, but its short legs and long arms and its feet were in many ways apelike.\n",
      "Studying the more than a dozen prints, scientists determined that the individuals had heels, insteps and toes almost identical to those in humans, and that they walked with a long stride similar to human locomotion.\n",
      "The researchers who made the discovery, as well as independent specialists in human origins, said the prints helped explain fossil and archaeological evidence that erectus had adapted the ability for long-distance walking and running.\n",
      "Erectus skeletons from East Asia revealed that the species, or a branch of it, had migrated out of Africa as early as 1.8 million years ago.\n",
      "The lead author of the journal report, Matthew R. Bennett, a dean at Bournemouth University in England, analyzed the prints with a new laser technology for digitizing their precise depths and contours.\n",
      "The tracks were excavated over the last three years by paleontologists and students directed by John W. K. Harris of Rutgers University in collaboration with the National Museums of Kenya.\n",
      "Daniel E. Lieberman, a professor of biological anthropology at Harvard who studies the evolution of human locomotion but was not a member of the research group, said the prints established what experts had suspected for some time.\n",
      "Erectus, he said, ''probably looked much like us, both walking and running over long distances.''\n",
      "Although the discoverers were cautious in attributing the prints to Homo erectus, Dr. Lieberman and other experts said in interviews that it was highly unlikely they could have been made by other known hominid contemporaries.\n",
      "''The prints are what you would expect from the erectus skeleton we have,'' said Leslie C. Aiello, president of the Wenner-Gren Foundation for Anthropological Research, which supported the research.\n",
      "William L. Junger, a paleoanthropologist at Stony Brook University in New York, said the footprints were further evidence that erectus had ''undergone a major structural change in body plan, and it's much like our own.''\n",
      "One obvious exception: the erectus brain, which was more advanced than those of previous ancestors, but was still much smaller than the Homo sapiens brain.\n",
      "No erectus foot bones have been found anywhere, but other well-preserved, yet incomplete, skeletons showed the species to be taller and less robust than earlier hominids.\n",
      "The strides of these footsteps suggest that the individuals were an average of 5 feet, 7 inches tall; one, presumably a child, was 3 feet tall.\n",
      "The site of the discovery is about five miles east of Lake Turkana, near the village of Ileret, in northern Kenya.\n",
      "Dr. Harris of Rutgers said that excavations from 2005 through last year yielded scores of animal tracks as well as the erectus footprints.\n",
      "Geological evidence indicates that they were made on the muddy surface of a floodplain in a time of nearby volcanic eruptions.\n",
      "Layers of volcanic ash, mixed with silt deposits, were examined to date the finds.\n",
      "The tracks were confined to two layers of sediment, vertically separated by 15 feet and about 10,000 years.\n",
      "The upper layer contained three footprint trails, two of two prints each and one of seven prints, as well as several isolated prints.\n",
      "The lower layer preserved one trail of two prints and a single isolated print.\n",
      "Dr. Bennett joined the project in 2007 to make three-dimensional digital records of the footprints.\n",
      "He also scanned the tracks of local people who walked through soil from the excavations.\n",
      "He said their prints, like those of other modern humans, were remarkably similar to the erectus prints.\n",
      "Later, digital images of casts of the prints from Laetoli showed marked differences in foot shapes.\n",
      "Anatomists analyzing the Ileret prints said the heel, instep, balls of the foot and short toes were considerably distinct from the prints discovered in Tanzania and almost identical to modern humans.\n",
      "Most obviously, the big toe is in line with the rest of the toes, not angling away from other toes, as on an afarensis foot.\n",
      "The footprints discovered in Kenya, researchers said, indicated that the erectus foot functioned much as a human foot does: the heel contacts the ground first; weight transfers along the arch to the ball of the foot; and the push-off is applied by the forefoot.\n",
      "In apes and apparently earlier hominids, this force comes from the midfoot.\n",
      "The discovery is ''even more explicit evidence,'' Dr. Harris said, that the erectus species extended its range into more diversified habitats, camping and discarding stone tools at sites far from the sources of the stone.\n",

      "PRIMM, Nev.\n",
      "-- For decades, a patch of casinos on the western edge of Nevada has relied on geography to lure California gamblers reluctant to drive the extra 45 miles for the glamour and glitz of Las Vegas.\n",
      "But as the economy took a dive, this desert spot suffered the same economic woes as its larger, flashier neighbor.\n",
      "And the troubles were exacerbated by the proliferation of Indian casinos in California, which offered much of the same attractions as any town in Nevada.\n",
      "The company that ran the trio of casinos here declared bankruptcy in 2009.\n",
      "Now Primm Valley Casino Resorts is betting that aggressively courting Latinos in Southern California will help lead to success.\n",
      "They have blackjack games with bilingual dealers and rules printed in Spanish on the tables, the first casinos in the state to do so.\n",
      "Last year, they began a series of concerts featuring popular Spanish-speaking musicians, which fill the arena to capacity nearly every time.\n",
      "On those weekends, the casino floor of Buffalo Bill's buzzes with an energy that executives say rivals New Year's Eve.\n",
      "''People have always said things like, 'That demographic doesn't gamble,' '' said Jay Thiel, the vice president of casino operations, who has worked in the industry for more than 30 years.\n",
      "''But we looked around one day and realized that that's who was here.\n",
      "We had no idea how wrong that idea was.''\n",
      "If any Latino organizations see a downside to this, they have not spoken out.\n",
      "Many Latino leaders say they are delighted with the attention to Hispanic consumers and have not expressed fears about introducing gambling into their lives.\n",
      "Mary Cuadrado, an associate professor of criminal justice at University of Texas at El Paso who has studied Latinos' seeking treatment for gambling addiction, said, ''The issue is not that people are going to become suddenly addicted, but there is evidence that Latinos are less likely to look for treatment if they do have a problem.''\n",
      "Stuart Richey, the assistant general manager and vice president for marketing at Primm Valley, said that while it had marketed to other niche demographics, like country music fans and retirees, ''no other group has inspired this much change in the way we do business.\n",
      "The impact is really just staggering.''\n",
      "When Espinoza Paz, a Mexican pop singer and composer, played to a nearly sellout crowd last weekend, every one of the resort's 2,600 rooms was booked.\n",
      "''People in Vegas would kill for those numbers,'' Mr. Richey said.\n",
      "The ways that the hotel has shifted to cater to that market can be spotted everywhere -- there are countless signs in Spanish: ''Juegue blackjack en su idioma,'' one announces -- ''Play blackjack in your language.''\n",
      "Another wishes diners ''buen provecho.''\n",
      "Managers are trying to find more dealers who speak Spanish, so they can teach those more comfortable with slots how to put down at least $5 a hand at a card table.\n",
      "The casino bar band has conga drums and roaming cocktail waitresses offering shots of top-shelf tequilas.\n",
      "''It feels comfortable here, like we're welcome and we belong,'' said Pascual Campos, 45, who came from Palmdale, Calif.\n",
      ", with his mother, his cousin, his wife and their two children.\n",
      "''I don't pay for rooms, I don't pay for meals, I don't pay for concerts.\n",
      "I just pay to play 21.\n",
      "They treat me like a king for that.\n",
      "Of course I want to come back.''\n",
      "Many of the guests coming in for the weekend were something of regulars.\n",
      "Like its counterparts in Las Vegas, the hotel tries to cultivate a kind of loyalty among gamblers by offering free meals, rooms and other perks to those who spend the most money.\n",
      "Here, someone who spends $1,000 in a weekend is seen as a high roller.\n",
      "In Las Vegas, that kind of spending would not even catch a pit boss's eye.\n",
      "Clearly, one of the main goals of the marketing is getting people through the casino doors who might not otherwise be there, or at least not as often.\n",
      "While the casino has put considerable effort into the Spanish-speaking tables, the slots are the game of choice here.\n",
      "There are scores of penny slots.\n",
      "''You don't need to spend a lot of money to win,'' said Lourdes Pena, 26, sounding like a commercial for the casino as she instructed her friend Maria Ramirez, 24 and a gambling rookie, to stick with two slot machines at a time.\n",
      "But there are times when gambling can feel beside the point.\n",
      "Children run freely through a video arcade, the line for the buffet stretches 100 people back and the area around the bar becomes an impromptu dance floor.\n",
      "Nobody seems to mind.\n",
      "The moments before the concert began looked like something like a multigenerational fashion show -- little girls in sparkling lacy dresses, women in figure-flaunting dresses and stilettos, men in rhinestone-encrusted belts and pointy snakeskin boots (the same kind Espinoza Paz favors).\n",
      "The elderly women using canes and wheelchairs donned perfectly pressed pantsuits.\n",
      "The crowd screamed out the lyrics along with the singer, and he was soon taking dozens of adoring fans onstage.\n",
      "A couple of especially eager women tossed their undergarments to him, prompting the singer to invite them onstage and croon a few bars to them.\n",
      "There were more than a few infants in the arms of their mothers, who eagerly danced to the band, which included a robust horn section.\n",
      "The first time the casino executives saw this kind of crowd last fall, they were taken aback.\n",
      "That concert, which featured the Mexican country singer Ramon Ayala, has taken on almost legendary status among the executives.\n",
      "None of them had even heard of the accordion-wielding singer, but the show drew a sellout crowd.\n",
      "More than three quarters of the casino's slot machines were occupied -- more than double a usual ''good night,'' Mr. Richey said.\n",
      "As the show ended Saturday night, dozens of fans stayed inside the arena to pose for pictures with the performer, who was happy to oblige.\n",
      "But the bigger crowd was already back in the casino.\n",
      "Within a few minutes, the slot machines that had sat unoccupied for the last couple of hours were all filled.\n",
      "The visitors, now lubricated with a few more shots of tequila, were eagerly feeding the slots.\n",

      "BEIJING -- Three prominent human rights groups called on China on Friday to release the imprisoned dissident writer Liu Xiaobo, who won the Nobel Peace Prize a year ago, and to end the house arrest of his wife, Liu Xia.\n",
      "Mr. Liu has rarely been allowed to talk to family members since the Nobel committee made its announcement on Oct.\n",
      "8, 2010, and he has been allowed to leave the prison where he is being held in Liaoning Province only once, according to the groups, Human Rights Watch, Amnesty International and China Human Rights Defenders.\n",
      "Ms. Liu has been kept under detention in the couple's home in Beijing but has not been charged with any crime.\n",
      "''The only thing that would force the government to reassess the decision is if there was some strong international pressure on China in this case, but the pressure is not there,'' Nicholas Bequelin, a researcher for Human Rights Watch, said in a telephone interview.\n",
      "''There's no incentive for the government to revisit this decision.\n",
      "We're talking about a climate where standing defiantly against the West is reaping more political awards than collaborating.''\n",
      "Mr. Liu, a longtime human rights advocate and writer, was detained on Dec.\n",
      "8, 2008, for playing a leading role in drafting Charter 08, which demands gradual political and legal reforms based on constitutional principles.\n",
      "The document was circulated via e-mail and was signed by thousands of Chinese, though Mr. Liu remained largely unknown within the country, in part because of government censorship.\n",
      "On Dec.\n",
      "29, 2009, a court in Beijing sentenced Mr. Liu to 11 years in prison for inciting subversion of the state.\n",
      "Security agents outside the Lius' Beijing apartment building prevented reporters from seeing Ms. Liu when the Nobel committee announced its decision.\n",
      "She was also barred from going to Oslo to collect the prize in December, and it was placed on an empty chair instead.\n",
      "It was the first time since 1936, when the Nazi government in Germany prevented the writer Carl von Ossietzky from collecting the prize, that no winner or representative had shown up for the ceremony.\n",
      "The Nobel committee announced on Friday that it was giving this year's Peace Prize to two women from Liberia and one from Yemen for their promotion of democracy and gender equality.\n",
      "A statement released by Amnesty International on Friday said that Ms. Liu had been almost entirely prevented from contacting anyone outside her apartment since February.\n",
      "She had a brief online chat at the time with a friend during which Ms. Liu ''said that she was feeling miserable, was unable to go out and that her whole family was being held hostage,'' Amnesty International said.\n",
      "Ms. Liu's mother lives in the same compound; she is the only person permitted to see Ms. Liu, and only on occasion.\n",
      "According to unofficial reports, Ms. Liu has been able to meet with Mr. Liu twice since January, Amnesty International said.\n",
      "Mr. Liu's Nobel Peace Prize has done little to blunt the Chinese government's harsh measures against dissenters.\n",
      "The country's leaders, anxious about Internet calls this year for protests modeled after the revolutions in the Middle East, have carried out a broad crackdown on liberal intellectuals.\n",
      "One of Mr. Liu's brothers, Liu Xiaoxuan, told Agence France-Presse this week that he had visited Mr. Liu in prison on Sept.\n",
      "28 and that he ''was looking very well.''\n",
      "Liu Xiaobo was allowed to travel to Dalian on Sept.\n",
      "19 to attend a memorial service for his father, the brother said.\n",
      "Human rights advocates said the Chinese government had allowed Mr. Liu's brother to leak news of his recent visit to the prison in order to demonstrate leniency on the eve of the anniversary of Mr. Liu's winning the Nobel Peace Prize.\n",
      "But fundamentally, the advocates said, nothing has changed regarding Mr. Liu or his wife.\n",
      "In its winter 2010 issue, Asia Literary Review published a poem called ''You Wait for Me With Dust'' that Mr. Liu had written for his wife.\n",
      "The final lines were:  Just let the dust bury you altogether  Just let yourself fall asleep in the dust  Until I return  And you come awake  Wiping the dust from your skin and your soul  What a miracle -- back from the dead.\n",

      "The only trouble with the otherwise honorable nightcap is that it has a diabolical way of turning into two or three, thus ceasing to be a nightcap at all but instead a formula for a rough morning.\n",
      "I've been down this road more than once, and it has taught me to regard the nightcap as a ritual performed to its greatest effect if I follow a few simple guidelines.\n",
      "A nightcap should be a one-off, not ''one more'' of whatever you're drinking.\n",
      "As much as I love a good cocktail, that's how to start a night, not how to end it.\n",
      "Your last drink should be set apart, so pick something special, something to sip slowly; one serving of one spirit, neat.\n",
      "When possible, I like to make a separate space for my nightcap: if I've whiled away a few perfectly pleasant hours at one restaurant or bar, I'll switch to another or drink that last one at home.\n",
      "A change of venue facilitates a change of pace and signals that the night is shifting down.\n",
      "A nightcap should also be brown.\n",
      "There are plenty of clear eaux de vie and other spirits that are said to settle the stomach after a luxurious repast.\n",
      "But a nightcap is different from an after-dinner drink or digestif.\n",
      "I stick with the classics: top-shelf whiskey, good brandy (usually Cognac), a burnished, potent, amber liqueur.\n",
      "As a coda, a nightcap also shouldn't stray too far from the movements that preceded it.\n",
      "It should bring them together and offer a fitting -- not a dissonant -- conclusion.\n",
      "If I've been drinking blended whiskey on the rocks, I'll move up to a different expression of the same spirit, like a slow-sipping single malt (nothing too smoky for me; Aberlour 18 and Bruichladdich 15 are two favorites).\n",
      "If I've been drinking wine all night, a cognac hits the spot.\n",
      "(Remy Martin V.S.O.P.\n",
      "is easy to find and very satisfying.\n",
      ") It's also derived from grapes and delivers a lingering, faintly ghostly winelike quality.\n",
      "When I crave something sweet, I go for my grandparents' favorite: B&B, a mixture of Benedictine (an herbal liqueur) and brandy.\n",
      "I also love Di Saronno Originale -- complex and seductive and suggestive of almonds, though there are none in the formula.\n",
      "Perhaps most important, a nightcap should be warming.\n",
      "I don't see the appeal of a chilled or an on-the-rocks drink soon before sleep.\n",
      "A great part of the allure is that a whiskey or a brandy might feel as if it has lighted a little fire at the back of the throat.\n",
      "After the initial burn subsides, a soothing comfort remains, the liquor equivalent of a cup of hot milk.\n",
      "Just much better.\n",

      "EAST RUTHERFORD, N.J.  It was half-past midnight when Tom Brady walked into the interview room, wearing his status as a three-time Super Bowl champion and renewed divisional front-runner resplendently well.\n",
      "There wasn't a wrinkle on his gray pin-striped, three-piece suit, with a white pocket handkerchief folded so its triangle pointed skyward like a mini foam index finger.\n",
      "It is not easy to look that good that late, but Brady, 34, remains the essence of unruffled N.F.L. royalty and the New England Patriots had no problem showing the Jets that they were still kings of the A.F.C. East on Sunday night at MetLife Stadium.\n",
      "The Jets could barely touch Brady, much less sack him.\n",
      "No.\n",
      "12 was as starched and unsoiled as his three-piece after the Patriots' 37-16 victory sealed the season series between the rivals and set a straightforward path for them to the playoffs.\n",
      "''It's kind of like you win and you move on,'' Brady said, evoking an image of the Jets being in the Patriots' rearview mirror, while echoing the smug and monotone say nothingness of his coach, Bill Belichick.\n",
      "Like it or not, he was right.\n",
      "Because if there was one overriding thesis to emerge from this unsightly Jets showing it was that they are not in the Patriots' class when it comes to carrying themselves like champions of anything -- if for no other reason than they never have been.\n",
      "Face it, Jets Coach Rex Ryan and the players who feel compelled to flex and fulminate are better off as the loud boor breathing heavily on you in the bar, the guy who may punch your lights out or fall down drunk before you ask him to move.\n",
      "If you're Ryan this week, getting ready for the Broncos in Denver on Thursday night, better to recultivate the reputation of the wild-card wild men who bragged and bullied and battled their way to consecutive A.F.C. championship games by going into hostile playoff stadiums and reveling in being the last men shouting.\n",
      "If they are going to make another run into late January, or even survive after the regular-season closer in Miami on New Year's Day, it'll apparently have to be the hard way, perhaps the more fitting Rx for a Ryan squad.\n",
      "It should be eminently clear by now that Coach Can-You-Hear-Me-Now and his Jets do not wear expectation especially well, too often tripping over their own loose tongues or their egregious on-field mistakes.\n",
      "Good for them when they can admit it -- ''worst play in N.F.L. history,'' Ryan barked into the NBC camera after quarterback Mark Sanchez's brain freeze of a timeout late in the first half handed Brady a minute-plus to go 80 yards for a touchdown and a 13-9 lead the Patriots never surrendered.\n",
      "For contrast's sake, Belichick, under those circumstances, would have gone with ''ill-advised'' or ''not what we needed at that particular juncture.''\n",
      "Not Ryan, who operates on the edges and whose team takes its behavioral cue from him.\n",
      "For consistency over the 16-game haul, this is not the most prudent approach.\n",
      "But get to the playoffs -- all on the line, live or die -- and the barroom brawler becomes a smarter bet.\n",
      "While Ryan mocked a past overstatement -- ''Maybe I should guarantee the fact that we're out of it.\n",
      "Yeah, we don't have a chance'' -- Belichick stayed in character, pleased with the victory that ''wasn't perfect'' but in which everyone ''stepped up.''\n",
      "In the Patriots' locker room, the winners acted so unmoved by the giant step they had taken toward another divisional crown, it was as if Belichick had engineered some grand show of ventriloquism.\n",
      "Along the row of receivers who blistered the Jets for all but 6 of Brady's 329 passing yards, the mouthy Chad Ochocinco excused himself from interview duty and left the forum to the cliche-ridden likes of Rob Gronkowski and Wes Welker.\n",
      "They all knew the lopsidedness of the victory was in part attributable to the Jets' acts of self-sabotage.\n",
      "Santonio Holmes fell on his way to the end zone on the Jets' first drive, and Nick Folk ended it by missing a 24-yard field-goal attempt.\n",
      "Sanchez's timeout was the most mindless of the self-inflicted misadventures, but three second-half turnovers led directly to 17 New England points.\n",
      "It wasn't quite the humiliation of losing, 45-3, to the Patriots on ''Monday Night Football'' last Dec.\n",
      "6.\n",
      "But this was at home, the Patriots had lost two straight and they had turned to an endless stream of people to replenish their battered defense.\n",
      "Brady & Company are still very much in control of the division, and if the Jets are going to pose any threat to them or anyone else in the playoffs they had better shore up their line play on both sides of the ball.\n",
      "They are not going anywhere if they can't rush the passer or protect their own.\n",
      "But at least they have their old, deep-seated second-class citizen status to compel them.\n",
      "They do rumpled much better than resplendent.\n",
      "It's the essence of who Ryan is, who the Jets have been -- all the way back to their Titans roots and Joe Namath's guarantee and the years when they had to be tenants in their own stadium to the Giants.\n",
      "Now they need to convince themselves they have the Patriots right where they want them.\n",

      "Fair or not, the most valuable player debate often comes down to the delicate balance between individual brilliance and team success.\n",

      "Since the 1994 strike, only six most valuable players have come from nonplayoff squads.\n",
      "If forced by convention, then, to narrow the field of potential candidates to members of playoff-bound teams, one player in particular stands out, having had a season that is among the best in baseball history (he is on pace for the 15th-best WAR of the expansion era at his position).\n",
      "He leads the major leagues in both traditional and advanced metrics, and his team is safely in first place.\n",
      "This player's name?\n",
      "Justin Verlander, owner of an American League-best 19-5 record, 2.28 earned run average, 212 strikeouts and 7.4 Wins Above Replacement.\n",
      "With statistics like that, Verlander should be leading the American League M.V.P. race, but if recent history is a guide, he has almost no chance to win the award.\n",
      "It is one of baseball's biggest paradoxes: the overpowering ace, perhaps the game's most prized commodity, cannot win the game's most prestigious individual award.\n",
      "Ever since Roger Clemens won it in 1986, starting pitchers have gone 0 for 48 in M.V.P. races.\n",
      "Moreover, Clemens and Vida Blue are the only starters to win the award in the last 40 years.\n",
      "Sure, a select few have come close.\n",
      "In 1999, Pedro Martinez put together one of the great pitching seasons in baseball history: 23-4, 2.07 E.R.A., 313 strikeouts (with only 37 walks), 8.3 WAR.\n",
      "But for his trouble, he finished second in the M.V.P. voting to Ivan Rodriguez, who was the A.L.'s eighth-best player by WAR that year.\n",
      "Martinez's 1999 campaign was not the only time in the past 25 years that a starting pitcher was snubbed by M.V.P. voters.\n",
      "In 1995, Greg Maddux posted a 1.63 E.R.A. and earned more WAR than any other player in baseball, but placed third in the eyes of the voters, right behind a player (Dante Bichette) who earned just 0.3 WAR.\n",
      "According to WAR, Clemens also deserved the award two more times (in 1992 and '97), while Bret Saberhagen ('89)and Randy Johnson ('99) tied for their leagues' most valuable performances.\n",
      "None finished higher than eighth in the M.V.P. voting.\n",
      "And just two years ago, Zack Greinke paced the A.L. in WAR, only to finish a distant 17th on the ballot.\n",
      "Why such flagrant voting bias against starting pitchers?\n",
      "The biggest factor is the presence of the Cy Young Award, which is annually given to the most outstanding pitcher in each league (and almost always goes to the top starter).\n",
      "Since, in essence, starting pitchers have their own award, voters have generally settled into a pattern of reserving the M.V.P. for the league's most outstanding hitter.\n",
      "This is illogical, of course -- nothing in the rules of M.V.P. voting says that the award should predominantly go to hitters.\n",
      "In fact, the term most valuable player is inherently position-neutral, suggesting that any player can win the award, as long as his value exceeds that of all others.\n",
      "Given the season Verlander has put together in 2011, it is hard to make the case that any A.L. player has exceeded his value to the Detroit Tigers.\n",

      "For 11 hours of secret grand jury testimony 36 years ago, Richard M. Nixon, a disgraced former president, fenced with prosecutors over his role in the Watergate scandals, bemoaned politics as a dirty business played by both sides and testily -- as he described his own demeanor -- suggested he was the victim of a special prosecutor's office loaded with Democrats.\n",
      "The testimony, which Nixon presumably thought would always remain secret, was released by the Nixon Presidential Library and Museum in Yorba Linda, Calif.\n",
      ", on Thursday in response to an order by a judge.\n",
      "The transcripts offered a remarkable portrait of Nixon after he left office: bitter at his disgrace and cynical about politics.\n",
      "He presented himself as a victim of governmental abuses by his enemies during his long career in politics, and said that prosecutors, with an eye to ingratiating themselves with the Washington media ''and the Georgetown set,'' were out to destroy him.\n",
      "''In politics, some pretty rough tactics are used,'' he said.\n",
      "''We deplore them all.''\n",
      "At one point, as he denied that his White House had engaged in anything out of the ordinary, he spoke with grudging admiration of what he said were the hardball tactics used against him by the Kennedy White House, asserting that it had directed the I.R.S. and other government agencies to discredit him as he ran for governor of California.\n",
      "''They were pretty smart, I guess,'' he said.\n",
      "''Rather than using a group of amateur Watergate bugglers, burglars -- well they were bunglers -- they used the F.B.I., used the I.R.S. and used it directly by their own orders against, in one instance, a man who had been vice president of the United States, running for governor.''\n",
      "By the time Nixon appeared at the grand jury, on June 23 and 24 of 1975, he had, by virtue of his pardon by Gerald R. Ford, immunity from any crimes he had committed, though he was still subject to perjury charges based on what he said to this grand jury.\n",
      "Nixon, a lawyer, repeatedly answered questions in a hedged and clipped manner, often saying he did not recall conversations, some of them just two years old.\n",
      "''I never recall any income tax return; I never recall seeing any result of any of this done,'' he said.\n",
      "Nixon repeatedly reminded his questioners that he had been preoccupied with grave matters of state, including the war in Vietnam.\n",
      "He seemed aware of how much he was claiming a failure of memory.\n",
      "''I want the grand jurors to understand that when I say I don't recognize something, it isn't because I am trying want to duck a question,'' he said.\n",
      "Stanley J. Kutler, a historian whose years of litigation helped lead to the release of the material, said he expected no shocking revelations from Nixon's testimony.\n",
      "But the hours of Nixon talking and sparring are a window on the personality of the 37th president.\n",
      "''If you know the voice of Richard Nixon, it's a virtuoso performance, from the awkward attempts at humor to the moments of self-pity,'' said Mr. Kutler, emeritus professor of history at the University of Wisconsin.\n",
      "''It's just terrific stuff.''\n",
      "In the course of his testimony, Nixon appeared to flatly deny accusations that the White House had used the I.R.S. to try to discredit a sitting chairman of the Democratic National Committee, Lawrence O'Brien, and that he had an enemies list.\n",
      "Tim Naftali, the director of Mr. Nixon's library, noted that in the Watergate exhibit on display there, there are tapes in which Nixon is heard ordering the use of tax audits against opponents and assembling an enemies list.\n",
      "''The grand jury testimony sheds more light on President Nixon's personality and character than it does on the remaining puzzles of Watergate,'' Mr. Naftali said.\n",
      "''Even under the protections of grand jury secrecy, which was inviolate at that point, the president, it appears, was unwilling to be more forthright about his role in what the House Judiciary Committee determined were abuses of government power.''\n",
      "Mr. Naftali noted that even with the protections of the grand jury testimony, Nixon did not answer what has been one of the biggest outstanding questions from the Watergate scandal: The reason for the 18 1/2-minute gap in a tape recorded in the Oval Office.''\n",
      "The distinctive Nixonian blend of pugnaciousness and self-pity comes through clearly in the 297 pages.\n",
      "Prosecutors' tape experts were ''these clowns.''\n",
      "He refers to G. Gordon Liddy, who headed the White House plumbers, as ''a very bright young man in one way, very stupid in others.''\n",
      "At another point, Nixon asserted that ''as a result of my orders, and I gave them directly, that never to my knowledge was anybody in my responsibility for heckling'' George McGovern, Nixon's Democratic opponent in 1972.\n",
      "''Now, actually my decision was not all that altruistic, to be quite honest,'' Nixon said.\n",
      "''My decision was based on the fact that I didn't think it would do any good.\n",
      "Why martyr the poor fellow?\n",
      "He was having enough trouble.''\n",
      "Nixon even directed some humor at himself, as he recalled telling Alexander M. Haig Jr., to look into the 18 1/2-minute gap on the White House tapes.\n",
      "''I said to him, 'Let's find out how this damn thing happened,' '' Nixon said.\n",
      "''I am sorry, I wasn't supposed to use profanity.\n",
      "You have enough on the tapes.''\n",
      "Nixon returns again and again to the notion that he was singled out for conduct that was common in politics and public life.\n",
      "He said he was the target of eavesdropping not just by Democrats but by the F.B.I.  ''The F.B.I. was at one point directed to bug my plane,'' he said, and J. Edgar Hoover, the F.B.I. director, ''once told me that they did.''\n",
      "Despite the decades that have passed, some passages were redacted because they contained still-classified information.\n",
      "Nixon told prosecutors that ''only if there is an absolute guarantee that there will not be disclosure of what I say, I will reveal for the first time information with regard to why wiretaps were proposed, information which, if it is made public, will be terribly damaging to the United States.''\n",
      "But his disclosure appears to have been cut from the transcript.\n",
      "In a ruling last July in historians' litigation over the Nixon archives, Judge Royce C. Lamberth of the District Court in Washington said he believed that the historical importance of Nixon's testimony justified a rare exception to the standard secrecy of grand jury records.\n",
      "Nixon often flashed his disdain for the prosecutors, whether he was belittling the way they asked their questions or accusing them of being partisan.\n",
      "''You can play that trick all, all day,'' Nixon admonished the prosecutor.\n",
      "''We can take all day on that.\n",
      "Ask the question properly.''\n",
      "''I am not unaware that the vast majority of people working in the special prosecutor's office did not support me for president,'' he said.\n",

      "San Francisco Ballet's latest program consists of three ballets that George Balanchine choreographed in America between 1934 and 1972: all classical, Romantic and modernist.\n",
      "The more you look (I attended the opening performance on Thursday night), the more you see that the very connections shared by the three ballets are also where they begin to be most dissimilar.\n",
      "In each case the curtain rises to show dancers standing still while the music plays: a favorite Balanchine method.\n",
      "The music serves not only as an overture but also as an ignition key; the performers stand at the ready.\n",
      "But ''Serenade'' (1934) begins with 17 women in calf-length skirts; ''Theme and Variations'' (1947) with ballerina and her male consort at center stage, surrounded -- like royalty at court -- by corps de ballet, the women all in tutus; and ''Stravinsky Violin Concerto'' (1972) with a ballerina and four men all in black-and-white rehearsal uniform.\n",
      "Those five dancers at the start of ''Stravinsky Violin Concerto'' hold a horizontal line, facing front, their arms linked.\n",
      "This recalls horizontal lines in the other two ballets.\n",
      "The third movement of ''Serenade,'' the Russian dance or Tema Russo, starts with a horizontal line of five women; and in the middle of ''Theme and Variations'' the ballerina is flanked by eight women, four on either side.\n",
      "Yet you no sooner spot these similarities than, again, you see how Balanchine does something entirely different with this horizontal line each time.\n",
      "What happens among the five women in ''Serenade'' -- characteristic of the whole ballet -- is an image of sisterhood, with women gesturally linking hands (and the outer women offering their hands outward as if to women who are yet to come).\n",
      "In ''Theme and Variations,'' while all the women remain on point, their feet quivering in response to the tremolando of Tchaikovsky's strings and their fingers meeting to make the arches of a portico or arcade (the five ''Serenade'' women pass through this pattern too); but now, as the oboe sounds, the ballerina's feet cease to quiver and then, on one supporting point, she starts to extend her other leg.\n",
      "(If you know ''The Sleeping Beauty,'' it's as if Princess Aurora were dancing at her own christening with her fairy godmothers but showing them the steps she will dance with her prince at her wedding.\n",
      ")  In ''Stravinsky Violin Concerto'' nothing is odder than how Balanchine makes the dancers wait motionless while the music has already begun to dance.\n",
      "Then we find these men aren't partners to this ballerina but are a busy backing group on either side of her.\n",
      "Their behavior, jazzily informal, is intricate, brisk, spruce.\n",
      "It's good to see all three ballets at San Francisco Ballet.\n",
      "Orchestral playing here -- conducted by Martin West (in ''Stravinsky Violin Concerto'') and David LaMarche (a guest from American Ballet Theater, leading ''Serenade'' and ''Theme and Variations'') -- is handsome.\n",
      "The company delivers performances where nothing is more engrossing than the choreography.\n",
      "The sense of selflessness is a crucial characteristic of good Balanchine style.\n",
      "The San Francisco dancers are a remarkably unmannered, elegant and grown-up company.\n",
      "The adult quality is impressive.\n",
      "Ballet elsewhere so often looks to be a matter for girls and boys, and I have accused both the Royal Ballet (though less so today than in the past) and  New York City Ballet (today) of having too many dancers who simply seem infantilized.\n",
      "Second and sometimes third casts will follow in San Francisco; I'd like to have seen them all.\n",
      "Sofiane Sylve, who danced for several seasons at New York City Ballet, performed two of Tuesday's ballets (as the Dark Angel in ''Serenade'' and in Aria I of ''Stravinsky Violin Concerto''): in her cool purposefulness, unfussy sophistication and sweep, you can see why some New York dancegoers still miss her.\n",
      "Yuan Yuan Tan, though unsatisfying in more classically refined roles, has even more drive and commitment, and is incisive in the other ''Violin Concerto'' role.\n",
      "Lorena Feijoo is over-stretched by the ''Serenade'' Russian dance; the company has women with more polish and bite than this.\n",
      "Most remarkable are two other women: Sarah Van Patten and Vanessa Zahorian.\n",
      "Ms. Van Patten is one of the most  inscrutable dancers before the public today, and in several roles she has the secret of keeping you in perpetual suspense.\n",
      "She plays the heroine of ''Serenade'' -- a woman to whom things, and in particular men, happen -- with a kind of innocent cool and absorption that reminds me of Kyra Nichols.\n",
      "Since she does nothing in terms of pathos to ask for your sympathy, it is with surprise that you find you have your heart in your mouth in watching everything that befalls her.\n",
      "Ms Zahorian has a rivetingly elegant physique, sparklingly precise legs and feet, a beautiful face offset by raven-black hair, and apparently complete technical accomplishment.\n",
      "She switches effortlessly from sustained adagio to scintillating presto, and the fluent conception of legato behind everything she does helps to give her the pose of a rare artist.\n",
      "I hope she will gain more serenity around the shoulders and the base of her neck and will start to suggest that the whole ballet, not just her role, is an act of her imagination.\n",
      "The company's men are also admirable: I particularly appreciated the calm flair of Pierre-Francois Vilanoba in ''Stravinsky Violin Concerto'' (Aria I), and enjoyed the lively attack of Anthony Spaulding (a soloist) in the same ballet's other lead male role.\n",
      "If Davit Karapetyan, who danced the principal man of ''Theme and Variations,'' could lighten up a little and look less as if he was concentrating on what will happen next, he may become an artist, and valuable; his technique is assured, his style noble.\n",
      "And the rest of the company is accomplished and brimful of talent.\n",
      "But it remains true, even with Ms. Van Patten and Ms. Zahorian, that the company is too discreet.\n",
      "Its artistic director, Helgi Tomasson, is celebrating his 25th anniversary in the post, and under him the troupe has become internationally recognized as a foremost leading exponent of Balanchine ballets.\n",
      "I have seen it excel during the past decade in works of his as diverse as ''Divertimento No 15,'' ''Bugaku,'' and ''Symphony in Three Movements.''\n",
      "But these three ballets on Thursday, like the ''Jewels'' performances I saw in June, could have used more cut and thrust.\n",
      "''What are you saving it for?''\n",

      "A federal judge on Friday issued an injunction preventing a rival liquor company from using a dripping wax seal on tequilas it sells in the United States, ending a seven-year legal battle.\n",
      "The ruling, by Judge John G. Heyburn II of United States District Court, comes in a long-running lawsuit between Maker's Mark, a unit of Fortune Brands, and Diageo North America and Casa Cuervo.\n",
      "''The court considers the red dripping wax seal inherently distinctive, because it is a unique mark used in an unusual way to draw in the consumer,'' Judge Heyburn wrote.\n",
      "Cuervo, which is based in Mexico, used a dripping red wax seal on special bottles of its Reserva tequila, which was distributed by Diageo.\n",
      "Judge Heyburn's ruling barred the companies from using the seal, but did not award damages to Maker's Mark.\n",

      "WASHINGTON -- Two Treasury secretaries, Henry M. Paulson Jr. and his successor, Timothy F. Geithner, on Thursday endorsed calls for stricter regulation of financial markets.\n",
      "In back-to-back testimony to the Financial Crisis Inquiry Commission, Mr. Paulson and Mr. Geithner faced questions about the so-called shadow banking system --  the network of investment banks, insurance companies, mortgage finance entities and hedge funds that largely went unchecked by a regulatory system that was structured around commercial banks.\n",
      "Mr. Paulson, a former chairman and chief executive of Goldman Sachs who led the Bush administration's response to the 2008 financial crisis, called the system ''archaic and outmoded.''\n",
      "He told Phil Angelides, the chairman of the commission, that ''we had excessive complexity in financial products.''\n",
      "Mr. Paulson called for heightened attention to several sectors of the markets, including securitization, the bundling of debts by underwriters who sell the assets to investors; repurchase agreements and commercial paper, major sources of short-term financing; derivatives contracts; and money market mutual funds.\n",
      "Mr. Paulson said that after his appointment in 2006 he tried to plug ''huge gaping holes in the regulatory system,'' including the risks posed by the mortgage finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.\n",
      "But Mr. Paulson admitted, ''Most of the toothpaste was out of the tube and there really wasn't the proper regulator apparatus to deal with it.''\n",
      "The legislation on financial regulations that is being debated in the Senate would direct regulators to require higher capital and liquidity for financial institutions -- a step that Mr. Paulson endorsed.\n",
      "''Everybody talks about capital, but to me the biggest lesson I learned out of all the crisis was the lack of focus by so many market participants and by regulators on the importance of liquidity,'' he told Bill Thomas, the commission's vice chairman.\n",
      "''And you cannot place huge reliance on any short-term overnight market if you don't ask yourself, 'What am I going to do if that market doesn't function as normal?\n",
      "How much of a cushion do I have?\n",
      "' ''  In response to a question by Brooksley E. Born, a former regulator whose calls for tighter controls on derivatives were rebuffed in the late 1990s, Mr. Paulson said: ''They didn't create the crisis, but they magnified it.\n",
      "They exacerbated it.''\n",
      "Mr. Paulson also called for greater transparency in derivatives trading, telling Heather H. Murren, a retired stock analyst who serves on the commission,  ''No one had any idea how many credit-default swap contracts were out there on General Motors bonds.''\n",
      "When Ms. Murren asked whether Wall Street's campaign contributions and lobbying had distorted government policy, Mr. Paulson instead blamed legislative inaction.\n",
      "''I do know that it is very, very difficult to get anything that's fundamental, controversial, difficult done at Congress without a crisis,'' he said.\n",
      "Mr. Paulson showed little sympathy for the argument that colossal financial companies -- which have grown only larger since the crisis -- should be broken up.\n",
      "''The level of concentration where we have 10 big institutions with 60 percent of the financial assets, this is a dangerous risk,'' he said.\n",
      "But he added: ''Now I believe these institutions are necessary.\n",
      "They perform a valuable role.''\n",
      "Even with better regulation and higher capital and liquidity requirements, he added, ''I come to the conclusion that regulation will never be perfect.''\n",
      "Mr. Geithner, who was president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York during the crisis, said he had tried to improve risk management based on the lessons from the collapse of the hedge fund Long Term Capital Management in 1998.\n",
      "''Those efforts were, in the end, fundamentally inadequate,'' Mr. Geithner said.\n",
      "''They did not do enough soon enough.\n",
      "They did not come with enough force and traction.''\n",
      "Yet he added, ''I do not believe we were powerless.''\n",
      "Mr. Geithner said that if ''better-designed constraints in risk taking'' had been in place, ''then this would have been less severe, and if the government had moved more quickly to contain the damage, I think the crisis would have been less severe as well.''\n",
      "He added that wide swaths of the financial system escaped monitoring.\n",
      "''You had people crawling over parts of the systems and parts of the system that are very risky, with nobody looking at it, nobody responsible, nobody in charge, and that was a tragic failure for the country as a whole,'' he said.\n",
      "''It was an avoidable failure, I believe.''\n",
      "Legislation being debated in the Senate would establish a financial stability oversight council and designate the Federal Reserve as the regulator for all of the largest financial institutions, not just big banks.\n",
      "The executive branch ''came into the crisis with the president having only emergency authority limited to the act of closing financial markets or declaring a bank holiday, actions in a crisis which are largely panic-increasing, not panic-containing,'' Mr. Geithner told Mr. Thomas.\n",

      "Last week, Wall Street's customers won a battle for more complete information about their brokers' past behavior, but were dealt a setback in a campaign for more time to sue over securities fraud complaints.\n",
      "The \"thrill of victory\" belongs to the state-level securities regulators, the self-styled advocates of the small investor.\n",
      "Their national organization, the North American Securities Administrators Association, has been battling for more than a year with the Securities and Exchange Commission and the National Association of Securities Dealers over how much of a brokers' disciplinary record should be made public.\n",
      "The states argued that pending allegations against brokers, as well as settled matters, should continue to be included in the Central Registration Depository, the public data base of required filings jointly maintained by the N.A.S.D.\n",
      "and the states.\n",
      "The S.E.C. and the dealers group wanted to limit the public files to resolved cases.\n",
      "On Wednesday, Lewis W. Brothers Jr., the Virginia securities director and president of the nationwide organization, announced that all sides finally agreed that pending matters should be listed in the filings for individual brokers, although they may be omitted from the corporate filings by securities firms.\n",
      "\"This will mean no loss of information in 90 to 95 percent or more of the inquiries now received from the public,\" said Mr. Brothers.\n",
      "\"We could not be more delighted\".\n",
      "The \"agony of defeat\" -- or, more accurately, the anxiety of delay -- is being felt among advocates of bills that would reverse a United States Supreme Court decision on June 20 in a securities fraud case known as Lampf, Pleva v. Gilbertson.\n",
      "The court's decision, aimed at replacing a hodgepodge of more lenient state rules, held that plaintiffs must sue within one year of discovering a potential fraud and within three years of when the fraud was committed.\n",
      "The court further applied the Lampf limitations retroactively, affecting a host of lawsuits that had been working their way through the courts for years, including civil cases whose defendants include Charles Keating and Michael Milken.\n",
      "Defendants already have sought the dismissal of those cases based on the Lampf decision.\n",
      "In response to the court's ruling, Senator Richard Bryan, Democrat of Nevada, attached an amendment to the Senate bill aimed at overhauling the nation's banking system.\n",
      "His proposal would give investors more time to sue than the Supreme Court did -- two years from the discovery of the fraud and five years from its commission -- and would permit lawsuits dismissed as a result of the Lampf decision to be refiled.\n",
      "But the overwhelming defeat on Tuesday of a House version of the banking bill has cast doubt on whether the Senate version can survive in anything but a stripped-down form, with no amendments.\n",
      "If that proves to be the case, it would shift the Lampf battle to two free-standing bills: Senate Bill 1533, the basis for the banking bill amendment, and House Bill 3185, proposed by Representative Edward J. Markey, Democrat of Massachusetts.\n",
      "Those favoring a reversal of the Lampf decision are not without powerful allies, including the S.E.C. and the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation.\n",
      "And Congressman Markey announced last week that he will hold hearings on Thursday on his bill.\n",
      "But it is not clear that either the House or the Senate would be able to put the free-standing bills to a vote before Congress closes down for its year-end break.\n",
      "The banking bill setback has been a boon to the forces lined up to preserve the Lampf decision.\n",
      "Lobbyists for that well-financed coalition, which includes the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants, the Securities Industry Association and the Public Securities Association, have peppered Congress with proposed amendments calling for sweeping changes in the securities litigation process.\n",
      "Those proposals range from a 20 percent cap on lawyers' contingent fees to a \"loser-pays-all\" provision that would assess all legal fees against the losing side.\n",
      "One set of proposals has been drafted for the Securities subcommittee of the Senate Banking Committee by Harvey L. Pitt, the Washington lawyer best known for negotiating Ivan Boesky's plea bargain with Federal prosecutors in the insider trading scandal of the 1980's.\n",
      "Another has been offered by Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky, who has warned that reversing the Lampf limitations and reinstating the cases now threatened with being dismissed would be a \"lawyer bonanza\".\n",
      "A common theme among them, however, is that Congress should do something to discourage frivolous lawsuits to make American businesses more competitive.\n",
      "\"We've broadened the debate a little,\" said Mark Gitenstein, a lawyer representing the coalition in favor of the Lampf ruling.\n",
      "\"Many people see a need to do something about the problem of frivolous litigation\".\n",
      "Peter Lockwood, a lawyer who favors reversing the Lampf ruling, is more cynical about the amendments being tossed around.\n",
      "\"If I can't defeat the proposal on the merits,\" he said, \"what better way to defeat it than to embroil it in a bunch of other proposals that are really controversial and that everyone will scream about?\n",
      "Congress might finally decide to avoid the whole issue\".\n",
      "Will the Markey bill be broadened to address concerns about frivolous litigation?\n",
      "One of his aides said Congressman Markey sees his bill as \"a fairly simple matter of fairness\" for those who have been defrauded in the securities markets.\n",
      "He added, \"Anyone who wants to suggest that a lawsuit against Michael Milken or Charles Keating is 'frivolous' is more than welcome to come to Washington and submit their case to Congressman Markey and the subcommittee on Thursday\".\n",

      "Barry Manilow has always straddled two musical worlds.\n",
      "As a recording star and arranger, he helped invent the modern, made-for-radio pop ballad in which crashing drums and soaring strings inflate greeting-card lyrics into tear-jerking bombast.\n",
      "As a theatrical showman, he is more of a traditional Broadway entertainer, one of the latest in a long line of likably hammy showmen that stretches back to the days of vaudeville.\n",
      "Those two worlds blended reasonably well on Wednesday evening at the gala opening of the Paramount, the new 5,600-seat theater at Madison Square Garden, where Mr. Manilow performed \"Showstoppers,\" his two-hour salute to Broadway.\n",
      "His engagement coincides with the release of his 23d and musically most satisfying album, also called \"Showstoppers,\" in which he sings Broadway standards accompanied by a 50-piece orchestra.\n",
      "For his four Paramount shows, the last of which is tomorrow night, Mr. Manilow unfortunately chose to substitute a small, cheesy-sounding ensemble consisting of synthesizers and a rhythm section for a full orchestra.\n",
      "In inviting Mr. Manilow to open the Paramount, the management of Madison Square Garden, which says the theater is named for the legendary movie and entertainment palace at Broadway and 43d Street, made an astute choice.\n",
      "In much the same way that Mr. Manilow conjures memories of Danny Kaye, Ray Bolger and Eddie Fisher, the new theater pointedly trades on the mystique of the old Paramount, which opened in 1926 and closed in 1964 and was the site of legendary concerts by Benny Goodman, the young Frank Sinatra and many others.\n",
      "The entrance to the new theater's lobby is lined with pictures of the old Paramount, each labeled with the slogan \"The best of times.\n",
      "Again\".\n",
      "But in reality, the new Paramount, much like Mr. Manilow's radio-ready records, is a modern, streamlined affair that offers a cordial if impersonal kind of grandiosity.\n",
      "One thing at least is certain.\n",
      "The Paramount, which replaces the Felt Forum, is an infinitely more attractive environment than its precedessor.\n",
      "The Felt Forum was so meagerly appointed that when attending a concert there, one always had the odd sensation of being outdoors and at the mercy of the elements.\n",
      "The Paramount, by contrast, provides an atmosphere of functional luxury.\n",
      "The Felt Forum's entrance on Eighth Avenue was difficult to find.\n",
      "The Paramount is entered from Seventh Avenue via escalators just south of the main entrance to the Garden's 20,000-seat arena.\n",
      "The photo-lined foyer leads to a spacious, crescent-shaped concessions lobby with an ocean-liner ambiance.\n",
      "For Wednesday's gala opening night, pianists in white tie and tails played simultaneously on five grand pianos arranged in a ring at the center of the lobby.\n",
      "The inside of the Paramount, which has an amphitheater configuration, is unusually wide.\n",
      "It has spacious aisles and an aura reminiscent of the largest modern Broadway theaters like the Minskoff and the Gershwin.\n",
      "The most striking visual feature is an overhead lighting design whose sculptured rays direct attention toward the stage.\n",
      "The seating is noticeably more cramped than in Manhattan's other large concert halls.\n",
      "The stage is capacious, though not cavernous, and on Wednesday the sound projected clearly through the theater.\n",
      "The sound system couldn't be blamed for a musical texture that throughout the concert had the feel of a canned soundtrack being piped in behind Mr. Manilow's voice, even though it was being played live.\n",
      "That tinniness, alas, is the aural common denominator of the sound of synthesizer-based instrumentation in theaters around Manhattan, unless extra care and expense are taken in the mixing and placement of speakers.\n",
      "Mr. Manilow's show offered a personalized crash course for the audience in the history of Broadway songwriting, with the star acting as a genial, homey master of ceremonies.\n",
      "Throughout the show, which opened with \"Give My Regards to Broadway\" and closed with \"I'll Be Seeing You,\" the star conveyed his genuine enthusiasm for a tradition that extends from George M. Cohan to Andrew Lloyd Webber.\n",
      "And although he doesn't have a traditional Broadway belter's voice, his warm, steady baritone infused many of the songs with an appealing sincerity.\n",
      "Stringing together a group of mostly familiar show tunes, Mr. Manilow and five guest performers enacted a crude boy-meets-girl, boy-loses-girl, boy-gets-girl scenario in the first part of the evening.\n",
      "The strongest moment was a heartfelt rendition of \"The Kid Inside,\" a little-known ballad by Craig Carnelia from the 1982 flop \"Is There Life After High School\"?\n",
      "Much of the second half of the evening was devoted to Mr. Manilow's rearrangements of his own hits in vintage musical theater styles.\n",
      "\"Mandy\" parodied the barbershop quartet from \"The Music Man,\" \"Read 'Em and Weep,\" became a Gilbert and Sullivan patter song, and \"New York City Rhythm\" a Harry Warren toe-tapper.\n",
      "Debra Byrd delivered \"I Am Your Child,\" as a \"Dreamgirls\"-styled gospel ballad, and Mr. Manilow and Michelle Micastro rendered \"Somewhere in the Night,\" as a parody of \"Tonight,\" from \"West Side Story\".\n",
      "Although the idea was clever, Mr. Manilow didn't take it very far.\n",
      "The transmutations amounted to the most superficial stylistic glosses, and in every case the alternate song paled beside the original.\n",
      "The show's funniest moment belonged to Donna Cherry.\n",
      "Putting on a series of wigs, she did caricatures of Julie Andrews, Cher, Dolly Parton and Madonna in rapid succession, all singing Mr. Manilow's \"Copacabana\".\n",
      "Ms. Cherry's turn was the only moment in the show that came close to doing what its title promised.\n",

      "In the past it may have been commonplace to walk out of films humming their theme songs, but these days an audience is more likely to be humming on the way in.\n",
      "Films have learned to rely on pop music for its catchiness while the credits roll, its help in glossing over continuity gaps and its effectiveness as a kind of shorthand.\n",
      "Music can establish mood or character in the space of only a few bars.\n",
      "For a film with problems, tacking on a hit record can be the aural equivalent of a Band-Aid, and an easy way out.\n",
      "In almost any set of movie trailers, there's bound to be one in which a hit song is played so prominently that it becomes the tail wagging the dog.\n",
      "When the hit is noticeably bigger than the movie -- Prince's \"Delirious\" or Roy Orbison's \"Only the Lonely\" -- this tactic seems especially ill-advised.\n",
      "And when the hit is too familiar (\"Born to Be Wild\" and \"Bad to the Bone\" should be off limits for motorcycle movies forever after), it can create an instant sense of deja vu.\n",
      "But this gambit is becoming more and more popular because it can be so powerful.\n",
      "In the right directorial hands, pop music becomes as central to a film as any flesh-and-blood character.\n",
      "Nancy Savoca's \"Dogfight,\" surely the only film to have accompanied a bedroom scene with Bob Dylan's raspy, acoustic \"Don't Think Twice, It's All Right,\" makes subtle, funny use of a soundtrack that understands the characters better than they understand themselves.\n",
      "The score divides itself between sunny, vapid pop hits suitable to its 1963 time frame, like \"Sugar Shack\" and \"Travelin' Man,\" and folk music that sounds sweetly, painfully earnest by comparison.\n",
      "When else has a movie heroine consoled herself by listening to Joan Baez's mournful rendition of \"Silver Dagger\" after a bad date?\n",
      "And when else has one ever tried on dresses to a Woody Guthrie song or tried to explain \"We Shall Overcome\"?\n",
      "Ms. Savoca, who is as delicately witty about popular music as she is about tense, uneasy relations between the sexes, sets up a wall of sound behind her film's thoroughly incompatible young lovers and lets the schism between their favorite songs become a running commentary.\n",
      "Within the overall scheme of the film, music takes on a pivotal role.\n",
      "Pop music has comparable importance for \"The Commitments,\" Alan Parker's vibrant Irish valentine to American rhythm-and-blues.\n",
      "In addition to finding something enjoyably comic about the way every last person in the film lives and breathes music and the way musical tastes in this atmosphere provide an ready definition of character, \"The Commitments\" eagerly capitalizes on the sheer entertainment value of its score.\n",
      "It will surprise no one that the movie's singing group has now undertaken engagements in real life, or that the film's outstanding performer, Andrew Strong, is now a prospective pop star.\n",
      "In this case, a symbiotic link between life and art has worked to the advantage of both.\n",
      "Certainly pop music lent a lot of punch to \"Thelma and Louise,\" and there again the music made a point.\n",
      "The powerhouse feminine energy of tracks by singers like Toni Childs and Charlie Sexton, or the version of Van Morrison's \"Wild Night\" belted out by Martha Reeves, contributed greatly to the film's breakaway spirit; in fact, just about every song on the soundtrack is a passionate embrace of freedom in one form or another.\n",
      "A lot of the music mixes doom with exuberance, thus enhancing the film's air of good-time characters headed for a bad-time fate.\n",
      "And all of it reinforces the film's wind-in-your-hair brand of exhilaration.\n",
      "Ever since film makers and audiences of baby-boom age began examining their past, pop music has gone beyond amplifying a film and sometimes been central, as in \"The Buddy Holly Story,\" \"La Bamba\" or \"The Doors\".\n",
      "Even the recent and forgettable \"A Matter of Degrees,\" about college life in Providence, R.I., focused on the fight to keep a local radio station free to program its own rock-and-roll, with disk jockeys sounding the message \"Rock-and-roll can save you\".\n",
      "In last year's \"Pump Up the Volume,\" gaining control of the airwaves was also accorded the importance of a subversive act.\n",
      "The effort to keep pop pure and meaningful takes on a certain desperation when a jingle like \"Help Me, Honda\" can be heard in a car commercial, and when so many films labor to include the obligatory rock video sequence (e.g., Julia Roberts, in \"Sleeping With the Enemy,\" trying on costumes to the irresistible strains of \"Brown-Eyed Girl\").\n",
      "So it's all the more pleasing when pop music is used as thoughtfully in movies as it has been by directors like Martin Scorsese, Jonathan Demme and Oliver Stone, all of them outstandingly adept at creating the kind of Greek chorus that makes an audience tap its toes.\n",
      "In \"Goodfellas\" and \"Born on the Fourth of July,\" Mr. Scorsese and Mr. Stone, respectively, created rich chronological backdrops for their stories by using the right songs.\n",
      "And Mr. Demme's \"Something Wild\" was made a lot wilder by Mr. Demme's unusually broad and buoyant musical tastes.\n",
      "Sean Penn's \"Indian Runner\" draws on both the memory of the Bruce Springsteen song (\"Highway Patrolman\") on which the film is based and on several Vietnam-era hits that are used to fine, insinuating effect.\n",
      "Mr. Penn's only musical lapse, among otherwise sensible choices, is the use of Bob Dylan's \"I Shall Be Released,\" as performed by the Band, over the closing credits.\n",
      "This is the pop equivalent of ending a film with \"Amazing Grace,\" which has been done well (as in \"Silkwood\") but overdone.\n",
      "Music in movies shouldn't amount to a short cut; it should be shorthand.\n",

      "Ralph Ginzburg, a taboo-busting editor and publisher who helped set off the sexual revolution in the 1960's with Eros magazine and was imprisoned for sending it through the United States mail in a case decided by the Supreme Court, died yesterday in the Riverdale section of the Bronx.\n",
      "He was 76.\n",
      "The cause was multiple myeloma, a cancer of the bones, said Shoshana Ginzburg, his wife and collaborator of 49 years.\n",
      "First published in 1962, Eros was a stunningly designed hardcover ''magbook'' devoted to eroticism.\n",
      "While Playboy and other men's magazines of the time catered mostly to male fantasies, Eros (named for the Greek god of love and desire) covered a wide swath of sexuality in history, politics, art and literature.\n",
      "Mr. Ginzburg valued good writing, and his contributors included Nat Hentoff, Arthur Herzog and Albert Ellis.\n",
      "Eros also challenged the taboo of interracial love in a photo essay by Ralph M. Hattersley Jr. and published a previously suppressed portfolio of nude photographs of Marilyn Monroe, taken by Bert Stern.\n",
      "Mr. Ginzburg's eventual conviction on the obscenity charge hinged not on the content of his publications but on their promotion.\n",
      "The Supreme Court held that if ''the purveyor's sole emphasis is on the sexually provocative aspects of his publications,'' that could justify a finding of obscenity for content that might otherwise be marginally acceptable.\n",
      "Born in Brooklyn on Oct.\n",
      "28, 1929, to immigrant parents from Russia, Mr. Ginzburg studied to be an accountant until his professor at City College encouraged him to accept an editorial job on the school newspaper, The Daily Ticker.\n",
      "With a passion for journalism, he took a job after graduation as advertising and promotion director at Look magazine and later became articles editor at Esquire.\n",
      "Mr. Ginzburg soon found he had a talent for the mail-order business, especially writing attention-grabbing promotional advertisements.\n",
      "He wed his business and publishing instincts to social activism.\n",
      "His first self-published book was ''100 Years of Lynching,'' a compilation of newspaper accounts that exposed American racism.\n",
      "Later he published ''An Unhurried View of Erotica,'' about the secret caches of erotic material in some of the world's most famous libraries.\n",
      "Eros, which was sold only through the mail, was conceived in a hardcover rather than a softcover format as a marketing ploy to extract a hefty cover price.\n",
      "Mr. Ginzburg hired the leading mainstream advertising typographer/art director, Herb Lubalin, to create innovative layouts for Eros.\n",
      "It cost him a lot of money to produce and never rose out of the red.\n",
      "When the fourth and final issue appeared (a fifth was prepared but never published), Mr. Ginzburg was indicted on charges of violating a federal statute that regulated obscene advertising.\n",
      "His publications (Eros; Liaison, a biweekly newsletter; and ''The Housewife's Handbook on Selective Promiscuity'') were deemed obscene ''in the context of their production, sale and attendant publicity.''\n",
      "After various appeals, the case was argued before the Supreme Court in 1965, and in 1966 Mr. Ginzburg's conviction was upheld.\n",
      "Despite protests by First Amendment advocates, he served eight months in a federal prison in 1972 after the Supreme Court refused to hear an appeal of his sentence.\n",
      "His book ''Castrated: My Eight Months in Prison'' (a short version of which was published in The New York Times Magazine) was dedicated to his wife and collaborator.\n",
      "As to why Eros was considered obscene, Mr. Ginzburg wrote in the book, it was a mystery to him.\n",
      "'' 'Obscenity' or 'pornography' is a crime without definition or victim,'' he said.\n",
      "''It is a bag of smoke used to conceal one's own dislikes with regard to aspects of sex.''\n",
      "The Eros case was just one of Mr. Ginzburg's famous run-ins with the courts.\n",
      "In 1964 another of his iconoclastic magazines, Fact, a political journal with a muckracking bent (and the first to publish Ralph Nader when he was a Harvard student), published a special issue on the ''Mind of Barry Goldwater'' when Senator Goldwater was the Republican presidential candidate that year, claiming that he was psychologically unfit for the office.\n",
      "Goldwater successfully sued him for defamation all the way to the Supreme Court; Justices Hugo L. Black and William O. Douglas dissented, citing issues of free speech.\n",
      "For Goldwater, it was a Pyrrhic victory; he received only $1 in damages.\n",
      "From 1968 to 1971 Mr. Ginzburg also published Avant Garde, an art and culture magazine designed by Mr. Lubalin, whose logo for the magazine was the basis for one of the most popular typefaces of the era.\n",
      "Although Avant Garde included erotic material (an entire issue was devoted to John Lennon's erotic lithographs), this time the focus was more on radical politics, including the ''No More War'' poster competition.\n",
      "Mr. Ginzburg shut down the magazine when he started serving his sentence.\n",
      "Afterward, he and his wife tried to revive it as a tabloid newspaper, but it lasted only one issue.\n",
      "It was a costly mistake that drove them to the brink of bankruptcy, which was averted only through the success of yet another periodical, the consumer adviser Moneysworth, which attained a circulation of 2.4 million.\n",
      "At 55 Mr. Ginzburg retired from publishing to be a photojournalist, selling his very first photograph to The New York Post.\n",
      "He remained there as a freelance spot-news photographer until his death and specialized in New York scenes and sporting events, covering soccer as recently as three weeks ago.\n",
      "In 1999 Eric Nash in The New York Times Book Review described his book of photographs, ''I Shot New York,'' as a heartfelt portrait of the extraordinary diversity of daily life in the city, and of New Yorkers' love of bread and circuses.''\n",
      "In addition to his wife, Mr. Ginzburg is survived by a son, Shepherd, of Ventura, Calif.\n",
      "; two daughters, Bonnie Erbe Leckar of Falls Church, Va.\n",
      ", and Lark Kuthta of Hewitt, N.J.; and three grandchildren.\n",
      "Despite Mr. Ginzburg's ability to transform his life at critical periods, he saw his conviction and imprisonment as a handicap since, at the time, few establishment organizations would do business with him.\n",
      "''Thus my publishing potential after release from prison was severely circumscribed,'' he said.\n",
      "''I have always felt that I might have become a major force in American publishing had it not been for my conviction.\n",
      "Instead, I'm just a curious footnote.''\n",

      "FIVE summers ago, a car bomb exploded in Netanya, an Israeli city on the Mediterranean, and everyone's first reaction was to fear the worst.\n",
      "It had to be another terrorist attack, people figured.\n",
      "Netanya, lying a mere 10 miles from the West Bank, had become all too vulnerable to Palestinian suicide bombers.\n",
      "But assumptions turned out to be wrong.\n",

      "One mobster had tried to do in another.\n",
      "What a relief, people said; it wasn't terrorism.\n",
      "''I prefer a criminal attack,'' Yehuda Madar of Netanya told me at the time.\n",
      "These days, New York has that in common with faraway Netanya.\n",
      "Bad things happen here, some bearing the potential for a huge loss of life.\n",
      "But as long as they are not the work of terrorists in search of martyrdom or who knows what, our reaction tends to be the same as it was in Netanya: Whew!\n",
      "We dodged a bullet.\n",
      "We experienced the phenomenon this week after an explosion destroyed a town house on East 62nd Street and wounded a few people, including the doctor who owned the property.\n",
      "First came fears of terrorism.\n",
      "Then came relieved sighs.\n",
      "From what the police say, the doctor, chasing whatever demons, may have blown up his own house.\n",
      "What a lucky break for us, most New Yorkers said.\n",
      "But why the high fives?\n",
      "With an altered circumstance or two -- say, people walking by at the wrong moment -- dozens could have been killed.\n",
      "The fact is that, despite the terror and high body count of Sept.\n",
      "11, 2001, New Yorkers are far more likely to be maimed or killed by a deranged fellow citizen than by someone with a Qaeda decoder ring.\n",
      "A few weeks ago, a man wounded four people during a 13-hour stabbing spree in Manhattan.\n",
      "Five people were stabbed in a similar rampage last year, three others in yet another attack the year before.\n",
      "Remember the driver who went on a hit-and-run spree in Midtown four years ago, killing a pedestrian and injuring two dozen others?\n",
      "Barely a weekend passes without some drunken dope losing control of his car and killing three, four, five or more innocents.\n",
      "The list is long.\n",
      "So why do we derive comfort from knowing that a disaster is caused by a disturbed soul or a souse?\n",
      "Mayhem is mayhem.\n",
      "And unless New York undergoes radical change, we are likely to have many more demented people among us than terrorists.\n",
      "''We tend to underreact to risks that are familiar -- they kind of recede into the background -- and overreact to risks that are new, in part because we don't know how bad they are,'' said George Loewenstein, a professor of psychology and economics at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh.\n",
      "Car wrecks and people going crazy -- those are ''known risks,'' Dr. Loewenstein said.\n",
      "But terrorism, 9/11 notwithstanding, still falls into an ''unknown-risk category,'' and that is scary.\n",
      "Paul Slovic, a psychologist who is president of Decision Research, a research institution in Eugene, Ore.\n",
      ", said that ''terrorist acts unnerve us because they do not follow the normal 'disaster plot,' which has a beginning, middle and end.\n",
      "We don't know what the scope of the planned aggression is.''\n",
      "''Terrorism, perverse as it is, has a rationality to it,'' Dr. Slovic said.\n",
      "''This seems worse than the deeds of one who is 'not in their right mind.\n",
      "' The 'right mind' of the terrorist wants to terrorize us.''\n",
      "With the town house explosion, there is an added factor, said Anthony R. Mawson, a professor of public health at Jackson State University in Jackson, Miss.\n",
      "Many people, he said, view the doctor as ''a man to be pitied rather than one to be feared.''\n",
      "BUT what if that attitude were to change?\n",
      "What if we began to regard the one who caused the explosion, whoever he was, as no better than a terrorist?\n",
      "Dr. Kerry J. Sulkowicz, a Manhattan psychoanalyst, said he would not be surprised if some New Yorkers now walk nervously past town houses wondering if they might go boom.\n",
      "''It is, of course, highly unlikely,'' Dr. Sulkowicz said.\n",
      "''But that's the effect of terrorism, to make people think that way.''\n",
      "For now anyway, we remain in Netanya mode: relieved that what occurred on 62nd Street falls comfortably into ''the not-threatening-to-me category,'' as Dr. Loewenstein put it.\n",
      "It might be worth noting, though, that bombs have gone off in Netanya several times in the last few years, with casualties in the dozens.\n",

      "It could be men are insensitive dolts who don't appreciate subtle human connections and good literature.\n",

      "''I must think of them first, and I can no longer put them through this ordeal.''\n",
      "The Justice Department's investigation of Mr. Abramoff's lobbying operation has left Republicans on the defensive in a year in which the control of the House could come down to a relative handful of races.\n",
      "In withdrawing two weeks before the deadline for replacing him on the ballot, Mr. Ney gave his party a better shot at hanging on to his seat, political strategists said.\n",
      "Mr. Ney is the latest political casualty of the Abramoff case.\n",
      "Mr. Abramoff pleaded guilty in January to conspiring to corrupt public officials, including members of Congress, and is cooperating with prosecutors.\n",
      "Two former top aides to Tom DeLay, the former House majority leader, have also reached plea agreements with the government in the case.\n",
      "Mr. DeLay, who is under indictment in Texas in an unrelated case, resigned from Congress this year partly because the Abramoff case had made him an even bigger political target for Democrats.\n",
      "Mr. Ney's former chief of staff pleaded guilty in May to conspiring with Mr. Abramoff to provide Mr. Ney with illegal gifts, including a 2002 trip to Scotland that allowed the lawmaker to golf at the fabled course at St. Andrews.\n",
      "Another of Mr. Abramoff's guests on that trip, David Safavian, a former White House budget official, was convicted in June of lying to investigators about his relationship with the lobbyist and the circumstances of the trip.\n",

      "As recently as last week, Mr. Ney, 52, insisted to aides that he would not resign from Congress, even if indicted, and that he would press on with his re-election campaign.\n",

      "She returned with a batch of recipes that have made their way onto the menu.\n",
      "They include Tahitian-style pork chops, a compelling reason alone to visit the restaurant: two thick, juicy, boneless chops napped with a lush pineapple demi-glace.\n",
      "The brown sauce had a rich tropical flavor with no hint of sweetness.\n",
      "Meltingly soft fried plantains also graced the plate.\n",
      "Ms. Connor and her partner, Pamela Wolfert, also own the Inn Spot in Quogue, a breakfast and lunch cafe, where Ms. Wolfert is the chef.\n",
      "The two-year-old Inn Spot on the Bay, which is an inn and a restaurant, already has a loyal following.\n",
      "On a cold, foggy Monday night last month, the turnout was surprisingly good.\n",
      "The location, right on Shinnecock Bay, is a crowd pleaser, especially in warm weather when the outdoor dining porch is open.\n",
      "The view is of a sloping green lawn with inviting Adirondack chairs, boats speeding by on the bay and, in the distance, the spit of land defined by Dune Road.\n",
      "Water views dominated the dining rooms, but even after dark we were impressed by the surroundings: an airy space with pale yellow walls, white wainscoting, dark wood floors and tables topped with white cloths and charming oil lamps.\n",
      "One night they were silver with sheer cloth shades; another time they were bamboo cages.\n",
      "Walls were dotted with attractive mirrors and original art.\n",
      "The most distinctive pieces were fashion drawings done by Ms. Connor's mother when she studied design in Paris in the 1950's.\n",
      "Service was attentive and accommodating.\n",
      "When a diner with a wheat allergy asked if the asparagus soup contained flour, the waitress said she would check.\n",
      "The chef came out to consult with the diner, offering to make the soup using stock that had not been thickened.\n",
      "The result was a creamy, luscious treat with fresh asparagus.\n",
      "The only noticeable flaw in the service was the way water was offered.\n",
      "Asked if we wanted flat or fizzy, we said flat and got bottled water ($6), which we really didn't want.\n",
      "When asked on a second night, we replied ''tap,'' which should have been included in the choices the first time.\n",
      "Start the meal with the light and crunchy croissant-crusted fried oysters, the best appetizer sampled.\n",
      "Two other sterling openers were the sprightly wakame seaweed salad and a crab and avocado cocktail presented in a martini glass with house-made shell-shaped crackers for dipping.\n",
      "We also liked the escargots encased in herb butter and baked in individual pastry puffs.\n",
      "Fried calamari were fork tender, but the coating was not crisp.\n",
      "Other misses were the bland lobster bisque and the ordinary Caesar salad in a creamy rather than classic dressing.\n",
      "There were no weak entrees.\n",
      "A special of braised cod in a Tahitian vanilla sauce was another lovely souvenir of Ms. Connor's trip.\n",
      "The thick piece of fish was crowned with melt-in-the-mouth onions and a sauce touched with coconut milk.\n",
      "Top picks from the menu included sesame-seared tuna served very rare, lump crab cakes dabbed with a creamy avocado sauce and accompanied by a tasty papaya salsa, and a dish called chicken fried chicken, two crisply fried boneless breasts in a country cream gravy with mashed potatoes and creamed spinach.\n",
      "Two other dishes not to be missed were the pot pie filled with big chunks of lobster, jumbo shrimp and scallops, and the steamed shellfish platter.\n",
      "It featured a mountain of mussels, a few shrimp and clams topped by a big red lobster, paired with a pot of melted butter.\n",
      "Desserts were homemade and worthy finales to a delightful meal.\n",
      "Earning kudos were the banana Napoleon of caramelized bananas layered with whipped cream and puff pastry, a moist black and white bread pudding topped with whipped cream, and a nearly flourless individual chocolate cake served warm with a scoop of homemade ice cream.\n",

      "Employers added only 121,000 jobs in June, the government reported yesterday, indicating that the economy was slowing under the combined weight of high energy prices and rising interest rates.\n",
      "But the government also reported that hourly wages rose at their fastest pace in five years, while the unemployment rate remained at 4.6 percent.\n",
      "This suggests that the labor market remains tight and may yet spur higher inflation.\n",
      "The disparate data underscored the uncertain economic situation facing the Federal Reserve as it ponders whether to continue raising interest rates over the summer to cool the economy further or whether it is time to pause.\n",
      "Over the last two years, the Fed has steadily increased the benchmark federal funds rate from 1 percent to 5.25 percent.\n",
      "''Today's numbers only tighten the vise the Fed finds itself in,'' said Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist of LaSalle Bank in Chicago.\n",
      "''The challenge is not to be overly restrictive as growth slows and still attentive to inflation risk.''\n",
      "Financial markets' reaction to the news was mixed, underscoring the difficulty in parsing an uncertain situation that seems poised between a cooling and an overheating economy.\n",
      "Stocks slid, weighed down by concerns about the implications for inflation of the rising wages recorded in the employment report as well as an earnings warning from 3M and lower-than-forecast sales from Advanced Micro Devices.\n",
      "Both the Dow Jones industrial average and the Nasdaq composite index were down more than 1 percent.\n",
      "[Page C6.\n",
      "]  Most Wall Street economists had been expecting considerably higher payroll growth.\n",
      "So, the price of Treasury bonds rose and the dollar fell against major currencies as the weaker job growth supported the view held by some investors that a slowing economy would allow the Fed to pause in its monetary tightening.\n",
      "Noting that the data suggested both that demand would slow and that the forces pushing inflation could intensify, Mr. Tannenbaum said, ''There's a fine line between stagflation and a soft landing.''\n",
      "With consumer prices rising at an uncomfortable rate of around 4 percent, the Fed and its chairman, Ben S. Bernanke, have been expecting the economy to slow from the torrid pace of 5.6 percent growth recorded in the first quarter.\n",
      "A slowdown would help damp the inflationary pressures that have been strengthened by rising energy prices.\n",
      "The weak payroll growth recorded in June by employers surveyed by the Labor Department appears consistent with this view, pointing to a cooling economy, weighed down by a slower housing market and moderating consumer borrowing and spending.\n",
      "Added to lackluster job growth in April and May, the weak hiring pattern in June brought the pace of job creation to about 108,000 a month in the second quarter, down from 176,000 in the first three months of the year.\n",
      "Employment in the construction sector remained essentially flat -- declining by 7,000 jobs as a contraction in residential building was offset by growth in construction of factories and other nonresidential structures.\n",
      "Employment fell at temporary-help agencies while the retail sector shed jobs for the third consecutive month.\n",
      "''We have had three months of very modest employment growth, which is consistent with an economy that has changed its underlying path,'' said Laurence H. Meyer, a former Fed governor and now chief forecaster at Macroeconomic Advisers.\n",
      "''The economy has slowed consistently, and momentum doesn't look like it is building.''\n",
      "This would suggest, some economists argued, that the Fed's string of 17 interest rate increases since 2004 is starting to do its job.\n",
      "The Fed could thus leave interest rates at 5.25 percent at its next meeting in August, rather than raise them by another quarter of a percentage point.\n",
      "''I think the Fed's going to pause,'' said Scott Anderson, senior economist at Wells Fargo in Minneapolis.\n",
      "Still, some economists noted that other indicators pointed to tightness in the labor market.\n",
      "In particular, hourly wages grew by 3.9 percent compared with June 2005, the fastest pace in five years.\n",
      "Moreover, the index of weekly hours worked, the broadest measure of labor use in the economy, increased by 0.4 percent in June.\n",
      "''For me, it is not clear-cut that the labor market has downshifted,'' said John Ryding, chief economist at Bear Stearns.\n",
      "''Rather than there is lack of demand from employers, it may be that low unemployment has left fewer people to hire, so instead employers are paying their existing workers more and are working their work force for longer hours.''\n",
      "To be sure, since the economy emerged from recession in 2001, wages have been merely trying to catch up with inflation, not spurring it.\n",
      "Consumer prices rose by 4.1 percent in the 12 months to May -- dwarfing wage gains.\n",
      "Though the inflation figure for June is not yet known, it could well overshadow the 3.9 percent annual gain in hourly wages last month.\n",
      "Moreover, labor productivity has been growing rapidly, keeping a lid on the rise in employers' spending on labor.\n",
      "''I've been surprised that wages have not already accelerated more than they already have in light of the strong economy and the low unemployment rate and the way headline inflation has constrained real wages,'' said Mickey D. Levy, chief economist at Banc of America Securities.\n",
      "Still, several analysts observed that the overall employment data does not support an optimistic view of inflation prospects, and do not let the Fed off the hook.\n",
      "With unemployment at its lowest since July 2001, wage pressures could build up more.\n",
      "''I expect the Fed will continue to go,'' said Richard Yamarone, chief economist at Argus Research.\n",
      "''The only part that supports a pause by the Fed is the headline payroll number.\n",
      "But on balance, the strength is still seen in the numbers.''\n",
      "Other indicators also suggest that the labor market remains tighter than the payroll numbers might suggest.\n",
      "Some 387,000 jobs were created in June, according to the survey of households, released by the Labor Department in tandem with the employer survey used to calculate payroll growth.\n",
      "While the employer survey is considered a more reliable indicator of the strength of the labor market, the household survey is thought by some economists to better capture jobs created by small and newly formed companies.\n",
      "And other unofficial indicators pointed to relatively strong hiring.\n",
      "This week, the payroll company Automatic Data Processing said that its payroll data suggested that employment increased by 368,000 in June.\n",
      "The index of the online job search firm Monster.com -- a leading indicator of job growth, based on help-wanted postings -- recorded a solid increase in June, driven by demand for white-collar workers.\n",
      "Some skilled occupations, like accounting, auditing, information technology, health care and transportation, appeared to be facing worker shortages.\n",
      "''Our employer customers continue to report concerns over turnover, particularly in occupations with acute skill shortages,'' said Steve Pogorzelski, president of Monster Worldwide.\n",
      "He added that the index showed growth in 18 of the 23 occupational categories used by the government and declined in only 2: personal care and services, and farming forestry and fishing.\n",

      "For years the white liberal heart of this Scarsdale-plush suburb of Johannesburg was so struck by the plight of blacks under apartheid that a chair, empty and black-shrouded, was kept at a symbolic place of honor here at City Council meetings, in sympathy for the powerless.\n",
      "But that chair and more, perhaps a majority of them, will soon be occupied by the first freely elected black council members in a newly welded municipality of blacks and whites, haves and have-nots, the hopeful and -- on this side of the old race-dividing freeway -- the increasingly wary.\n",
      "The token chair already seems quaint in the face of constitutional liberation that guarantees black council representation from Sandton's municipal opposite: the teeming slum of Alexandra, whose black shantytown residents have long served as the maids and gardeners on the splendid properties of Sandton.\n",
      "Political Transformation  This is but one of the stunning political turnabouts to be wrought by the nation's push to full democracy in which minority whites are being peacefully upended from total power.\n",
      "The Sandton-Alexandra nexus will be among the most critical arenas, for it is on the municipal level of schools and streets, housing and police that the details of equality must be spelled out most credibly if the new South Africa is to proceed undivided against itself.\n",
      "\"We've been emotionally involved with Alex for years,\" said Peter Gardiner, a city Councilman and former Mayor of Sandton, recalling more patronizing times when whites here channeled monetary and moral aid across to Alexandra as open resistance to the white apartheid national Government was building.\n",
      "\"Now, the pink liberals that I represent are no longer relevant,\" the gray-haired executive said, with a doubt-laced smile, about the coming integration.\n",
      "He says he regrets that some of his less liberal constituents have begun to hunker down, trying to privatize police and educational services before the dawn of the worrisome era of sharing their rich tax base with the deeply pathetic needs of Alex.\n",
      "Over there, politicians can be found fairly salivating over the prospects of majority power and vowing to aid families packed into kennel-like hovels as they await the fulfillment of President Nelson Mandela's promise for rapid reconstruction.\n",
      "'It's Evolution Now'  \"The times of revolution are over -- it's evolution now,\" said Podile Molovi, one of the black politicians of Alex, who has been negotiating with Mr. Gardiner about their joint future.\n",
      "\"We need their expertise,\" Mr. Molovi said of the whites.\n",
      "\"We need them to empower us.\n",
      "To calm their fears, we only have to engage them in dialogue\".\n",
      "No one who appreciates grass-roots politics expects the task to prove one of ebony-and-ivory lyricism.\n",
      "But during the same three-year transition period in which the national Government successfully prepared for the power shift accomplished by Mr. Mandela, local jurisdictions have been meeting informally in the advent of their unions.\n",
      "Under apartheid, local black-only elections in Alex were engineered by the white Government as a Potemkin rite of self-determination and had little credibility.\n",
      "Sandton whites, on the other hand, have been as active in politics as affluent burghers in America, controlling most of the public benefits.\n",
      "The precise nature and workings of the new combined municipality of squatter shacks and suburban manses remains to be negotiated and enacted, but the Constitution now mandates the timely redress of the gross imbalance suffered by Alex.\n",
      "Multiracial Power-Sharing  If localities resist unification, the law requires the newly elected provincial premier, similar to a state governor, to order a multiracial, power-sharing solution.\n",
      "Such a new reality is quickly rendering moot the old politics of white supremacy and inviting interesting new mixtures of politicians and localities.\n",
      "\"We're the ham in the sandwich,\" Mr. Gardiner said, summarizing the role of the Sandton tax base in all this.\n",
      "\"We expect deterioration of local services, definitely.\n",
      "But people here understand you're paying for peace of mind because your conscience is badly burdened\".\n",
      "He spoke as the unabashed supporter of racial liberalism that rewarded him with 20 years' incumbency in this community of business executives, creditworthy civil servants and backyard domestics numbering in the tens of thousands.\n",
      "White panic is not a major threat, he said.\n",
      "Increased crime, he tells his constituents, has been due to the worsening conditions in ghettos like Alex.\n",
      "\"Children were starving and were coming here to help themselves,\" he said.\n",
      "Far less empathetic analyses can be overheard in the small talk of residents who frequent Sandton's many California-style shopping malls, where handguns are a steady seller.\n",
      "The spectrum of concerns in the new union will be enormous.\n",
      "Sandton, a community of 165,000, seems a utopian preserve where three-car families are ringed by nannies and electronic security gates.\n",
      "Residents have been pouring money into private security forces and fast-response crisis centers to protect themselves amid luxury lawns and backyard swimming pools.\n",
      "But in Alexandra, where the population has quadrupled to 300,000 in the past decade, \"anti-crime\" is an almost amusing notion amid a feral existence.\n",
      "Survival is far less sophisticated in the deadly violence of upheaval and fresh invasions of the homeless caught in running gun battles.\n",
      "In one small niche, 52 families driven from coveted cinder-block homes in Alex by organized thugs have been living for the last two years in a single gymnasium-size room at the East Bank Community Center.\n",
      "The scene is a terrifying-looking fire hazard as uprooted families cook, sleep, play, hope, quarrel and await the unknown amid cardboard dividers and eddies of furniture.\n",
      "\"A few people believe with Mandela's coming to power, we're going to take white people's houses,\" Victor Smith, an elder of the packed cardboard community, said with a sardonic smile.\n",
      "\"That's not true, of course.\n",
      "It's just a big dream\".\n",
      "But dreams are easily teased forth by Sandton, a community whose luxuries and business profits were, in effect, subsidized for four decades by the low-cost mass black labor engineered under apartheid.\n",
      "\"I worked as a maid over there,\" said Balungie Xubu, 31, a mother of three living in an Alex labor barracks.\n",
      "\"I'd be always anxious looking around that beautiful house, but I remember wishing to myself that my kids could grow up in a place like that,\" she said of her daydreams during her $9-a-week job.\n",
      "Like others in Alex, Mrs. Xubu said great patience was needed before even small improvements would appear under the new politics of the Mandela era.\n",
      "Even so, when Alexites talk of the high hopes for their children, nearby Sandton is a frequent image they summon.\n",
      "This only puts advance pressure on Alex's newly ascendant politicians like Mr. Molovi.\n",
      "He did very well in organizing the pro-Mandela vote in the national election, but the task of supplying material improvement to hard-pressed people like Mr. Smith and Mrs. Xubu will be far more difficult.\n",
      "Razing Ivory Towers  The task will be doubly complex if the needed third piece of the new municipality turns out, as many expect, to be Randburg, a more racially mixed community of 165,000.\n",

      "The Palestine Liberation Organization chairman's visit to the land he calls home defied all predictions.\n",

      "Huge crowds were expected to swamp Jericho and Gaza to honor him.\n",
      "They simply didn't materialize.\n",
      "There weren't any massive Jewish demonstrations against him either -- a testament, perhaps, to a recognition that if the Arabs weren't going into a frenzy, why should Israelis?\n",
      "So the first lesson of the visit seemed to be that the majority of Palestinians, and Israelis, had matured into believers in the peace process in the weeks and months before Mr. Arafat finally arrived in Gaza on July 1.\n",
      "But that was not entirely comforting news for Mr. Arafat.\n",
      "Many times in his exile in Tunis, he had heard that his 2 million fellow Palestinians who were enduring Israeli occupation -- those \"of the inside\" in the P.L.O.'s argot -- were a tenacious and skeptical people.\n",
      "And now he was seeing the reality: They are demanding and skeptical about him as well.\n",
      "Throughout the visit, Palestinians from all walks of life got a further message to the P.L.O. as well: that they expect better government, not sloganeering.\n",

      "Most of the rest of the P.L.O. leadership has melted away, having been removed by him, having resigned or having simply not survived the test of respect and popularity.\n",
      "But it doesn't mean he is the only Palestinian offering a strategy.\n",
      "Hamas, the Muslim fundamentalist movement, still calls for war with Israel and last week resumed its attacks on soldiers and settlers in the West Bank.\n",
      "Democratic critics of Mr. Arafat like Haidar Abdelshafi, who led the Palestinian negotiators at the Madrid peace conference in 1991, are sitting on the fence -- having withdrawn to register their objections to Mr. Arafat's one-man ruling style, and to avoid blame for supporting a deal that may not improve people's day-to-day lives.\n",
      "And in the refugee camps of Lebanon, Syria, and Jordan, militant leftists say they will destroy the peace accord if they can.\n",
      "Against all those rivals and adversaries, Mr. Arafat has only one real option -- to widen support for his deal among Palestinians \"of the inside\".\n",

      "His customary mobilizing skill was evident in his first speech in Gaza, where he filled the air with sweeping if vague nationalistic phrases alluding to martyrs and the struggle for Palestine and for Jerusalem.\n",
      "But that quickly faded when it was met with a lack of effusiveness.\n",
      "In his next few speeches, Mr. Arafat did something he hasn't done in a long time -- he talked directly to his audiences, not above their heads.\n",
      "In Gaza and in Jericho, he reached out for support, asked for patience, and demanded unity.\n",

      "Echoes of Reality  By the end of his visit, Mr. Arafat found himself saying similar things.\n",
      "In his speech to the meager 8,000 people who came out in 113-degree heat to greet him Wednesday in Jericho, he described his accord with Israel as \"the best agreement we could get in the worst possible situation\".\n",
      "With its overflowing sewers, its teeming population of a million, an unemployment rate of 50 percent and its pressing demand for immediate attention, the reality of Gaza had simply swept aside all the symbolism of the exile's return.\n",
      "Throughout the five days here, Mr. Arafat heard delegation after delegation of Palestinians ask him to get relatives out of jail, fix the inadequate roads and power lines, and lift the economic depression.\n",
      "It was telling that shortly after he arrived, Mr. Arafat announced that he would live in the highly politicized Gaza Strip -- not in far more docile Jericho, the West Bank agricultural town and winter resort where he had first planned to make his home.\n",
      "\"Jericho is the symbol, but Gaza is the reality,\" said Nabil Shaath, the most senior Palestinian official in the National Palestinian Authority, which rules the two autonomous regions.\n",
      "\"This is where a majority of the Palestinians live\".\n",
      "Mr. Arafat reflected his uncomfortable metamorphosis in increasingly realistic responses.\n",
      "He inaugurated an Italian-funded citrus plant, gave the go-ahead for design work on a new port in Gaza, announced the planned construction of 30,000 housing units, and spoke of an \"agricultural revolution\" to come.\n",
      "As important, he skirted his much-promised vow to pray in Jerusalem, accepting the Israeli view that at this point it would be far too inflammatory.\n",
      "As he went on to his second, third, fourth and fifth day of visits he peeled off the honor guards, the music bands and other pompous accouterments that had marked his arrival.\n",
      "There is little doubt that Mr. Arafat felt some relief when he left for Paris Wednesday for the less demanding mission of collecting a UNESCO peace prize.\n",
      "He left the date of his return to Gaza undefined, but among his aides there was a palpable recognition that his old life style of hopping from one country to another to give speeches is over.\n",
      "Given the mood of his people, if he is to retain his role as their leader he is going to have to return here to live -- and to govern.\n",

      "FOR centuries, countless millions of babies have endured severe, lasting and unrelieved pain during and after circumcision, a fact that has just recently been recognized by the medical profession.\n",
      "In fact, a new study by pediatric researchers at Rochester General Hospital in upstate New York showed that the pain of circumcision was so severe that a popular over-the-counter pain reliever for infants failed to alleviate their suffering during and immediately after the procedure.\n",
      "Still, while 86 percent of newborn boys in this country are circumcised, the procedure is widely performed without any sort of anesthesia.\n",
      "The Rochester study, directed by Dr. Cynthia R. Howard and published last month in the journal Pediatrics, did find that infant Tylenol (a liquid form of the painkiller acetaminophen) can help infants cope with the lingering pain of circumcision several hours after the procedure.\n",
      "In the study, 23 healthy newborns were given acetaminophen drops starting two hours before circumcision and then once every six hours afterward for a total of 24 hours.\n",
      "A comparable group of 21 infants received a dummy medication.\n",
      "Judging from changes in the babies' heart rates, breathing, crying, facial expressions, consolability and sucking behavior, the researchers determined that the analgesic drops had little or no pain-relieving effect during and immediately after the circumcision, probably because \"the pain is too severe,\" they concluded.\n",
      "The researchers suggested that the pain might interfere with the ability to breast-feed and \"may potentially contribute to breast-feeding failure\".\n",
      "Apart from this study, infants at Rochester General and some other hospitals are routinely given a short-acting regional anesthetic called a penile nerve block before circumcision.\n",
      "In addition, babies are swaddled in a blanket instead of being strapped to a board and are given a pacifier to suck for further comfort.\n",
      "\"The majority of our babies sleep through the procedure,\" Dr. Howard said, adding that she would recommend using acetaminophen drops to provide continuing relief after the anesthetic wears off.\n",

      "Mayor Richard M. Daley's vision of his city, fussily and stubbornly enforced, is many things: rooftop gardens, wrought-iron fences, waterfront parks, bicycle trails, beds of blooms beside every road.\n",
      "Massive mounds of rubbish are not on his list, and Mayor Daley, the man many people here have come to consider Mayor for Life, just as they did his father before him, rarely accepts alternatives to his vision, or to anything else for that matter.\n",
      "So on Wednesday, with a garbage strike at private waste-hauling companies dragging into Day 8, and with the Chicago Cubs drawing the eyes of a nation to Wrigley Field for the first time in ages, and with temperatures soaring into what was quickly becoming the odorous upper 70's, Mayor Daley dispatched his city workers to scrub Chicago's alleys.\n",
      "Not to intervene, mind you, in a strike between private companies and their union workers.\n",
      "Not to touch the disputed trash deep in the big hauling bins.\n",
      "But rather to clean up above, around and on top of those bins, and above all, to keep Hizzoner's city gleaming, or as gleaming as a city can be when tens of thousands of tons of trash are decomposing all around into puddles of unrecognizable goo.\n",
      "Around the corner from Wrigley Field and the neighborhood of pubs and restaurants that surround it, a trash hauling bin was packed with old French fries, beer bottles, straws, ketchup and a cluster of gleefully buzzing flies.\n",

      "But a crew in a baby-blue Streets and Sanitation Department truck was already cruising a few alleys away.\n",
      "Though its job is ordinarily limited to picking up waste from single-family homes and small buildings, this time it also stopped off behind large apartment buildings to pick up stray cups and cans and to clear off bags that were falling from commercial hauling bins.\n",
      "They even stopped to accept a personal donation -- a stuffed green bag -- from Leza Bernard, a desperate resident who ran out to meet the city truck, saying she could not be sure when her trash might next be picked up.\n",

      "Jane M. Byrne, the city's first female mayor, was elected after her predecessor, Mayor Michael A. Bilandic, was seen as having allowed some 35 inches of snow to be left on the streets during two weeks in the winter of 1978-79.\n",
      "\"That poor planning for the blizzard was not the kind of city we're used to,\" Ms. Byrne recalled on Wednesday.\n",

      "For the moment, she said, Mayor Daley is politically secure, of course, as he always has been.\n",
      "\"He's got time,\" she said, quickly adding a warning, rooted in her own history: \"This is a union town, and people will tolerate the garbage for so long, but then they will come to expect the mayor to intervene\".\n",
      "And although Mr. Daley did not publicly weigh in on the garbage strike on Wednesday and has said that he wants to allow the parties to work out their problems on their own, he has made his irritation for this whole messy sideshow abundantly clear.\n",
      "After sending crews out to clean up around the private companies' trash piles, he announced that someone -- the companies or the workers -- is going to have pay the city back for its trouble.\n",
      "\"The main thing,\" said Roderick Drew, the mayor's spokesman, \"is that he will not allow this strike to jeopardize the health and safety of the people in Chicago\".\n",
      "So as a federal mediator and representatives for 3,300 striking Teamsters workers and for the Chicago Area Refuse Haulers Association argued into the night Wednesday in a suburban office complex, city workers were putting in extra hours, adding some 40 trucks to the streets, and tidying up the alleys to try to meet their boss's vision.\n",
      "The association, which represents 17 private hauling companies, handles trash collection -- about 20,000 tons a day -- for businesses and large apartment buildings in the city as well as for suburban counties.\n",
      "In Wrigleyville, the North Side neighborhood where postseason play was drawing thousands of people -- and scores of television cameras -- to see the Cubs try to disown their lovable-losers history, a bleary-eyed supervisor from the sanitation department wandered through the alleys in an S.U.V. topped with a flashing light.\n",
      "He stopped at overflowing trash bins, studying the damage and calling for backup.\n",

      "People who come here from anywhere in the world comment on how clean the mayor keeps it.\n",
      "So the mayor has stepped up efforts to make sure we go after any uncontained garbage\".\n",
      "Meanwhile, perhaps in the spirit of a place that works, or at least works things out whatever the rules, some people were devising their own solutions.\n",

      "If all goes according to President Obama's plan, the United States will soon be making a major new investment of $5 billion so that other countries can help in the fight against extremists.\n",
      "Regardless of how sensible such a proposal might sound, many things can go wrong, and the new program already seems too heavily dependent on military responses.\n",
      "Mr. Obama introduced the initiative at his West Point commencement speech last month, saying he would establish a network of partnerships with countries from South Asia to Africa.\n",
      "The goal is to train and equip foreign security forces, so they can conduct counterterrorism operations with little American involvement.\n",
      "The past 13 years have proved that it would be impossible, as well as unwise and unnecessary, for the United States to assume responsibility for every terrorist threat.\n",
      "Terrorist threats are unquestionably out there.\n",
      "Despite the administration's success at reducing the core Qaeda group behind the 9/11 attacks, Mr. Obama acknowledged that ''for the foreseeable future, the most direct threat to America at home and abroad remains terrorism.''\n",
      "The threat has become more diffuse, involving extremists in Syria, Nigeria, Somalia, Yemen, Mali and elsewhere.\n",
      "The result is that while there is less likelihood of a 9/11-style attack on the United States, there is a greater danger of attacks on Americans overseas, as in Benghazi or the shopping mall in Nairobi, Mr. Obama said.\n",
      "Mr. Obama said his Counterterrorism Partnerships Fund would offer expanded help to vulnerable countries, including Iraq, Lebanon and Turkey.\n",
      "The idea isn't new, although Mr. Obama would greatly increase the funding beyond the millions of dollars already being spent annually.\n",
      "In recent years, the United States has increasingly relied on partner countries to help in the fight against extremists.\n",
      "The Pentagon is providing intelligence and logistics assistance to other groups, like African troops and French commandos fighting militants in Somalia and Mali.\n",
      "And it is also training foreign troops in countries like Niger, Yemen and Afghanistan to confront insurgents on their own territory, so American armies won't have to.\n",
      "Mr. Obama has revealed few details of his program, which must be approved by Congress and reportedly is still in the planning phase.\n",
      "But there are serious questions about the effectiveness of past counterterrorism efforts, and experts say the government has never systematically evaluated what works and what does not.\n",
      "Iraq is one cautionary example of how much can go wrong.\n",
      "Even though the United States spent years and $25 billion to build up the Iraqi Army so it could defend the country, entire units disintegrated last week in the face of assaults by Islamist insurgents, and untold amounts of valuable weapons fell into enemy hands.\n",
      "In another case, soldiers in Mali overthrew the government in March 2012, even though United States Special Operations troops had trained Malian forces.\n",
      "As described by Mr. Obama, it appears that the new program is intended to be run out of the Pentagon.\n",
      "That would be a mistake.\n",
      "To be effective, the program must also address the social and political drivers of instability and involve civilians as well as military officials.\n",
      "For instance, training must involve not just soldiers but police officers, judges and prosecutors, with a strong emphasis on the rule of law and human rights, so cracking down on extremists does not end up radicalizing more people or empowering authoritarian leaders.\n",
      "An emphasis has to be placed on good governance.\n",
      "There also needs to be investment in community projects, education and moderate groups that build civil society and discourage extremism.\n",

      "Last week in London, Sotheby's and Christie's evening sales offered a combined total of 131 pictures by artists born before 1850.\n",
      "More than half of them were either unknown, or unknown to anyone who had not studied art history.\n",
      "''There is an issue of branding here,'' said Andreas Pampoulides, head of fine arts and business development at the Mayfair branch of the Spanish dealers Coll & Cortés.\n",
      "''There aren't so many brand artists in Old Masters, but when they do appear, they can sell for stratospheric prices.''\n",
      "That was why Christie's in their July 8 sale included a painting cataloged as the work of Johannes Vermeer, 17th-century Holland's most coveted painter, despite debate over its authorship.\n",
      "From the collection of the late Johnson & Johnson heiress Barbara Piasecka Johnson, ''Saint Praxedis'' was listed by Christie's as Vermeer's earliest surviving painting, dating from the 1650s.\n",
      "Vermeer's authorship of this untypical copy of an Italian painting, showing a female saint squeezing a martyr's blood out of a sponge, was first suggested in 1969, but it has never gained general acceptance from scholars and curators.\n",
      "Christie's produced new analysis of paint samples that gave them the confidence to pronounce it a Vermeer with an estimate of 6 million to 8 million pounds.\n",
      "At the sale, the painting attracted little competition and was bought for £6.2 million, or $10.6 million, including fees by an unidentified Asian bidder in the room.\n",
      "''Collectors remained skeptical,'' the London dealer Charles Beddington said.\n",
      "''It wasn't a subject you want from Vermeer.''\n",
      "Christie's found buyers for 53 percent of the 68 lots they offered, generating a total of £45 million against a low estimate of £42.6 million.\n",
      "A few market-fresh rarities did attract bidding duels.\n",
      "The New York dealers French & Co., for instance, paid £4.8 million, more than double the low estimate, for an impressive and unrestored 17th-century Dutch still life cataloged as the work of Willem Claesz Heda.\n",
      "But otherwise lot after lot either sold for the low estimate, or went unsold.\n",
      "''It was a bloodbath,'' said the veteran New York dealer Richard L. Feigen.\n",
      "''The sale didn't have a single spectacular picture.\n",
      "Old Masters have been neglected and all the money has flowed into modern and contemporary.''\n",
      "Fears of an imminent Old Master meltdown were calmed the next evening when Sotheby's 63-lot auction achieved an above-estimate £68.3 million, the highest total the company has earned for the category in London, without factoring in inflation.\n",
      "The selling rate was a reassuring 81 percent by lot.\n",
      "Sotheby's had the edge on this occasion thanks to quality paintings from four prestigious private collections, including the English aristocratic families of the Earl of Warwick and the Duke of Northumberland.\n",
      "The house also exhibited highlights from the sale in Hong Kong in April, helping to trigger interest from new buyers who are all-important for the long-term survival of a market that until the 1980s was Sotheby's and Christie's main money-earner.\n",
      "A bidder, represented by Patti Wong, chairwoman of Sotheby's Asia, pledged £7.7 million for a rediscovered late 18th-century George Stubbs painting of leopard cubs at play, £6.8 million for a signed and dated 1613 Jan Brueghel the Elder oil on copper of the Garden of Eden and £3.9 million for a winter landscape with a bird trap by Pieter Brueghel the Younger.\n",
      "Stubbs and the Brueghel family are internationally known names, giving confidence to the client, identified by Alex Bell, Sotheby's International Old Master department head, as an Asian collector, to bid significantly over estimate for all three paintings.\n",
      "Tellingly, there was little demand for two long-admired 15th-century Florentine tempera-on-linen drapery studies that had lost their big-name stamp.\n",
      "Also from the collection of the late Mrs. Johnson, these had been bought as the work of Leonardo da Vinci at auction in 1989, but soon afterward were re-attributed to an artist in the workshop of Leonardo's master, Andrea del Verrocchio.\n",

      "Neither of those gains has probably happened since the 1960s, according to demographers.\n",
      "The gains were all the more striking because in many cases they reflected the mirror opposite of change in some suburban counties, which historically have followed a different demographic trajectory from the city.\n",
      "While the city's non-Hispanic white population rose since 2010 (by a modest 24,000, or 1 percent, with the biggest gain in Brooklyn), it declined in the New York suburbs by 54,000, or 2 percent.\n",

      "The rift followed allegations that Islamic fundamentalists had plotted to infiltrate and take over schools in Birmingham, home to a significant Muslim population.\n",
      "The claims are as yet unproved, but they have divided ministers on whether they should concentrate on tracking suspects thought most likely to commit acts of terrorism or wage a broader cultural battle at the community level against the spread of fundamentalist theology.\n",
      "The disagreement within government underlines the sensitivity of the issue in a country in which Muslims radicalized in British cities have committed acts of terrorism, including the murder last year of a soldier, Lee Rigby, on a street in south London.\n",

      "It is unclear what steps schools took in response to the document, and several government bodies are looking into the case.\n",
      "In all, 21 schools are being investigated over claims that male and female pupils were segregated, that sex education was banned and that, in one case, a cleric linked to Al Qaeda was praised in a school assembly.\n",

      "According to news reports, the leaked report from the Office for Standards in Education, Children's Services and Skills, or Ofsted, detailed several criticisms of one school, Park View, and said it had done too little to warn pupils about the dangers of extremism.\n",
      "The issue spilled over into Mr. Cameron's cabinet last week in a briefing published in The Times of London, which the prime minister's office now acknowledges came from the secretary of state for education, Michael Gove, suggesting that the department of the home secretary, Theresa May, had been too tolerant of the efforts by hard-liners to infiltrate the Birmingham schools for fear of being seen as Islamophobic.\n",
      "The briefing suggested that the Home Office was not confronting extremism until it developed into terrorism, and had failed to ''drain the swamp'' in which it bred.\n",
      "It was also critical of Ms. May's counterterrorism adviser, Charles Farr.\n",
      "In response, the Home Office released a letter that Ms. May had written to Mr. Gove, accusing his department of inaction when related concerns about Birmingham schools were brought to his attention in 2010.\n",

      "PITTSBURGH -- As the Mets took the field here Thursday, Bobby Abreu went to left field, Curtis Granderson to right and Juan Lagares to center.\n",
      "Abreu was playing because he had not played the previous four days.\n",
      "Granderson was playing because he had been the Mets' hottest hitter in June.\n",
      "And Lagares was playing because, on his first day back from the disabled list, he needed to regain his timing and his form.\n",
      "Manager Terry Collins had to explain his reasoning because, with Lagares rejoining the team, the Mets' outfield was as crowded as the L train during morning rush hour.\n",
      "The team had six outfielders in all, five of whom had played regularly at times this season -- the three starters on Thursday, as well as Chris Young and Eric Young Jr.  ''Terry is going to have to get creative,'' the assistant general manager, John Ricco, said while standing near the dugout hours before the Mets lost to the Pirates, 5-2.\n",
      "Before the game, Collins had mulled over a few of the Mets' possibilities in jest.\n",
      "He joked that he would ask Clint Hurdle, the Pirates' manager, if he could use a roving outfielder.\n",
      "Collins also said he would like to substitute on the fly, as coaches do in hockey, or maybe have his players specialize in either offense or defense, as they do in football.\n",
      "Collins will probably have to juggle his outfield daily, playing to the matchups, to keep everyone sharp and happy.\n",
      "He would like to find some consistency, but he has been unable to do that all season.\n",
      "In their first 78 games, the Mets used 20 different starting outfield combinations, tied for the fourth-most in baseball, according to the Elias Sports Bureau.\n",
      "Lagares's injuries had been a cause of that.\n",
      "He missed 13 games in April with a hamstring injury and 22 games in June with a rib-cage injury.\n",
      "When he was healthy, he played like a mainstay, but he, too, had been rotated in and out.\n",
      "The outfield situation might have felt less stressful if the Mets had demoted outfielder Kirk Nieuwenhuis instead of Wilmer Flores, their young infield prospect, to replace Lagares.\n",
      "Flores, the Mets said, had proved that he could play shortstop.\n",
      "But because Ruben Tejada had improved -- he had posted a .\n",
      "348 on-base percentage in June entering Thursday -- Flores had played sparingly, and that had visibly affected him.\n",
      "Flores, the Mets figured, could play regularly with Class AAA Las Vegas, and they could survive with Eric Campbell as their emergency backup at shortstop.\n",
      "As for Tejada, Collins said, ''This is a good chance for Ruben to realize he's the guy.''\n",
      "Tejada went 1 for 3 Thursday, and the Mets' starting outfielders combined to go 2 for 9, with two walks and three strikeouts.\n",
      "The Mets, in general, could not solve the Pirates' starter, Vance Worley, who held them to one run in seven innings.\n",
      "In stark contrast to the Mets, the Pirates were carried by their outfield.\n",
      "Andrew McCutchen, the National League's reigning most valuable player, went 1 for 3, and Gregory Polanco, a prospect called up on June 10, introduced himself to the Mets with a three-run homer off starter Daisuke Matsuzaka in the fifth inning, helping the Pirates pull away.\n",
      "Polanco, 22, seemed poised to play right field for the Pirates for years to come.\n",
      "On the pitch Polanco hammered, Travis d'Arnaud had originally called for a changeup.\n",
      "But Matsuzaka shook him off and threw a hanging slider.\n",
      "''I need to apologize to him about it,'' Matsuzaka said.\n",

      "DUBAI, United Arab Emirates -- Souq.com, an online retailer based in the United Arab Emirates, said on Monday that it had raised $275 million from international investors.\n",
      "It was a vote of confidence for digital commerce in the Middle East, which has made little headway compared with elsewhere.\n",
      "Souq, the largest e-commerce company in the Middle East, was founded in 2005 on an eBay-like online auction model, but it subsequently evolved into more of an Amazon-style set-price retailer.\n",
      "It has been a rare success story in a region where online businesses face logistical problems, political challenges, stifling bureaucracy and regulations that vary greatly from country to country.\n",
      "Souq's latest round of funding included money from the New York-based investment firm Tiger Global Management, as well as from Standard Chartered Private Equity and the International Finance Corporation, which is an arm of the World Bank.\n",
      "Souq, which means market in Arabic, did not provide details on what the funding round meant for its overall valuation, and it has not released details on its annual sales or profit.\n",
      "The $275 million funding round was, however, the largest ever disclosed by a technology start-up in the Middle East and North Africa, according to Wamda, a research firm based in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates.\n",
      "Even after multiple fund-raising rounds, the Jabbar Internet Group -- which sold Maktoob, a news site, to Yahoo for more than $150 million in 2009 -- still holds a majority stake.\n",
      "''The start-up scene has changed so much since Souq launched over 10 years ago,'' Ronaldo Mouchawar, the chief executive of Souq, said in an interview, ''and the size and scope of this kind of funding is encouraging for entrepreneurs.''\n",
      "Mr. Mouchawar said the company would use the funds to bolster its technology, such as payment processing, and to help increase the scale of its operations by improving logistics.\n",
      "Souq also hopes to introduce new product categories, particularly related to beauty and fashion, and to recruit employees, he said.\n",
      "In particular, it will look to improve its mobile application; Mr. Mouchawar noted that 70 percent of purchases from Souq in Saudi Arabia, the Middle East's second-biggest market, were made on phones.\n",
      "Souq, now the largest online retailer in the Arab world, ships hundreds of thousands of products across the six countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council: Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.\n",
      "It also has operations in Egypt.\n",
      "''Most local retailers -- whether they will openly admit it or not -- are fully aware that customers can find products cheaper online, whether locally or on global sites,'' said Alexandra Tohme, an independent e-commerce analyst with more than a decade of marketing experience in the region.\n",
      "''In some cases, even heavy items with shipping charges still generate savings of up to 50 percent compared to brick-and-mortar stores.''\n",
      "Ms. Tohme said Souq's particular success was driven by competitive prices compared with other retailers in the region, and by its reputation for reliable delivery.\n",
      "Several other online retailers have tried, and failed, to overcome the myriad difficulties of e-commerce in the Middle East.\n",
      "Barriers to trade across the region remain high and include tariffs, varying national laws and different currencies.\n",
      "Political instability can also be an obstacle in countries like Egypt, whose population of nearly 90 million has endured heightened levels of violence since an uprising in 2011.\n",
      "The high costs associated with online retail can also discourage start-ups.\n",
      "As a result, several major online retailers have struggled: Joob, an online travel website started by the Jabbar Internet Group, folded with little explanation a year after its introduction in 2011; the German start-up fund Rocket Internet closed Mizado, an Amazon copycat, in 2012, after just five months of operation, to concentrate on the online shoe retailer Namshi, it said.\n",
      "That same year, the online daily deals website LivingSocial abruptly exited the Middle East.\n",
      "The market's potential remains attractive, however.\n",
      "''By the end of the decade, two-thirds of the region will have smart devices -- supercomputers in their pockets -- which means increased innovation, problem-solving and purchasing power,'' said Christopher M. Schroeder, an American venture capitalist.\n",

      "The attention to the details of investigative work and the texture of cops' lives is impressive, and occasionally Bosch delivers a short lecture on some aspect of Los Angeles history as a bonus.\n",
      "The flip side of all that conscientiousness is that the show -- developed by Eric Overmyer of ''Treme'' -- never quite catches fire.\n",
      "It's highly satisfying but not often exciting.\n",
      "The producers, many with roots in European television, have gone for a modest tone and a slow-burn narrative that can feel more admirable than addictive.\n",

      "But after that, for the second straight start, Gooden alleviated most doubts with another mini-comeback in his major comeback attempt.\n",
      "In limiting the Cardinals to one run for the next four innings, Gooden struck out the side on 12 pitches in the second inning and retired 13 of the last 16 Cardinals he opposed on a night when the Yankees beat Manager Joe Torre's former team, 9-5, at Legends Field.\n",
      "The Cards started only three regular players because they lost to the Chicago White Sox, 5-4, in a split-squad game today, so Gooden faced an ordinary lineup.\n",
      "Gooden conceded that his curveball was inconsistent, that his fastball was erratic, that he did not use his changeup enough and that he must avoid beginning games by digging a ditch.\n",
      "The early troubles caused him to uncork 88 pitches in five innings.\n",

      "With two starts left before opening day, Gooden realized he has considerable work to do.\n",
      "He still labors to locate his fastball and curveball and strays from using a changeup that he has designated as a critical pitch.\n",

      "With a Supreme Court ruling two years ago having failed to settle the debate over permissible limits on demonstrations at abortion clinics, the Justices agreed today to examine the issue again in a new case from upstate New York.\n",
      "The question for the Court this time is whether protesters have a free-speech right, protected by the First Amendment, to approach abortion patients as they make their way toward a clinic entrance and to offer unwanted \"sidewalk counseling\" aimed at dissuading the women from having abortions.\n",
      "The Federal appeals court in New York, by a 13-to-2 vote last September, upheld a lower court's imposition of a buffer zone around abortion clinics in the Rochester and Buffalo areas.\n",
      "The buffer zone not only keeps demonstrators 15 feet away from clinic entrances but can also be invoked to cover \"any person or vehicle\" entering or leaving the property.\n",
      "While two \"sidewalk counselors\" are permitted to enter the 15-foot zone at any one time, the lower court's order says they must \"cease and desist\" and leave the protected area as soon as a person \"who is sought to be counseled wants to not have counseling\".\n",
      "Judge Richard J. Arcara of Federal District Court in Buffalo issued the injunction in 1992 after finding that members of an anti-abortion group called Project Rescue were routinely \"harassing, badgering, intimidating and yelling at\" patients entering abortion clinics in the area.\n",
      "A three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, in Manhattan, splitting 2 to 1, found the buffer zone to be unconstitutionally restrictive in a decision issued in September 1994, three months after the Supreme Court had addressed related issues in an abortion-protest case from Florida.\n",
      "The full Second Circuit then re-examined the case and reached the opposite result, with the two judges on the original panel's majority, Thomas J. Meskill and Frank X. Altimari, then cast in the role of dissenters.\n",
      "The Supreme Court decision, in June 1994 in a case called Madsen v. Women's Health Center, upheld a 36-foot buffer zone around an abortion clinic in Melbourne, Fla.\n",
      "A state-court injunction prevented demonstrators from \"congregating, picketing, patrolling, demonstrating or entering\" the zone.\n",
      "Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, writing for the 6-to-3 majority that upheld the buffer zone, found that it \"burdens no more speech than necessary to accomplish the governmental interest at stake\": ensuring public safety and protecting unimpeded access to the clinic by patients and staff.\n",
      "But at the same time, the Court struck down a broader, 300-foot \"no-approach\" zone in which anti-abortion demonstrators were prohibited from approaching anyone who had not indicated \"a desire to communicate\".\n",
      "That prohibition was too broad, Chief Justice Rehnquist said.\n",
      "In the majority opinion upholding the New York injunction, Judge James L. Oakes said the 15-foot buffer zone was justifiable because it was \"far more solicitous of the demonstrators' interest\" than the zone the Supreme Court had struck down in the Florida case.\n",
      "That was because the New York injunction permits demonstrators to approach patients, even without an invitation, and deliver their anti-abortion message until the patients walk away or tell them to stop.\n",
      "Judge Oakes wrote a low-key opinion with the evident goal of fitting the New York injunction into the structure the Supreme Court had outlined in the Florida case.\n",
      "A concurring opinion by Judge Ralph K. Winter applied a much more provocative First Amendment analysis, however, so it might have been this opinion that persuaded the Justices to review the case.\n",
      "Judge Winter said that under the First Amendment, there was no need to \"tolerate coercive or obstructionist conduct solely because it serves some passionate ideology or interest\".\n",
      "He added: \"The First Amendment protects peaceful communication, not self-indulgence.\n",
      "Nor need we tolerate such conduct because it makes the advocate feel good.\n",
      "The First Amendment is not a governmental version of the psychiatrist's couch\".\n",
      "Oddly, Judge Winter's opinion, labeled a concurring opinion, had the votes of 10 judges, compared with nine signing the majority opinion by Judge Oakes, raising the question of which was the actual opinion of the appeals court.\n",
      "(With 15 judges participating in the case, there was considerable overlap among the supporters of each opinion).\n",
      "In appealing, lawyers for two anti-abortion demonstrators emphasized the implications of the appeals court's First Amendment analysis.\n",
      "They said that in past rulings, like those upholding the right to burn an American flag as a political statement, the Supreme Court had not allowed the demonstrators' First Amendment rights to be curtailed by the distress caused to onlookers.\n",
      "\"It is difficult to conceive of speech on a controversial issue that would not cause anxiety to someone,\" the appeal said, adding, \"Once accepted, that rationale would leave the First Amendment in tatters\".\n",
      "The appeal, Schenck v. Pro-Choice Network, No.\n",
      "95-1065, was filed by the American Center for Law and Justice, a law firm founded by Pat Robertson, the television evangelist.\n",
      "Perhaps the most interesting question about the Court's action today is whether the Justices will approach the case -- which will be argued next fall -- as a case about abortion-clinic protests or about the free-speech rights of protesters in general.\n",
      "Last year, for example, the Court heard a case on whether the organizers of the St. Patrick's Day parade in Boston could exclude marchers who wanted to identify themselves as gay and lesbian Irish-Americans.\n",
      "While the case was widely viewed as a gay-rights issue, the Court's unanimous opinion upheld the First Amendment right of the organizers not to be forced to carry an unwanted message, and it dealt only tangentially with the fact that the would-be marchers were homosexual.\n",
      "The Court is unlikely to have taken the new case to revisit issues it resolved in the 1994 Madsen decision.\n",
      "While Justices Antonin Scalia, Clarence Thomas and Anthony M. Kennedy were vigorous dissenters in that case, arguing that the Florida injunction was an unconstitutional effort to censor the anti-abortion message, Chief Justice Rehnquist's majority opinion was equally firm in analyzing the injunction as a neutral effort to protect public safety that did not require the strict constitutional scrutiny the Court reserves for Government actions that curtail speech on the basis of its content.\n",
      "It is probably evident to the Court, however, that the 1994 decision left a number of questions unanswered.\n",
      "For several months, the Justices have been considering whether to hear an appeal from a ruling of the California Supreme Court, which applied the Madsen decision to uphold an injunction that confines demonstrators to an area across a four-lane street from an abortion clinic in Vallejo, Calif.\n",
      "The Justices will now presumably defer action in that case, Williams v. Planned Parenthood, No.\n",
      "95-576, until it decides the New York case next year.\n",
      "In a separate action today, the Court in an unsigned opinion upheld a Federal appeals court's ruling that requires the Arkansas Medicaid program to pay for abortions for poor women who have become pregnant through rape or interest.\n",
      "A provision of the Arkansas Constitution forbids the use of state money for any abortion \"except to save the mother's life\".\n",
      "But a Federal Medicaid-law provision known as the Hyde Amendment provides broader coverage, which a number of Federal appeals courts, including the Eighth Circuit in this case, have held to require equivalent coverage by all states participating in the Medicaid program.\n",

Morgan, a psychologist who fought the Germans and Japanese behind enemy lines in World War II, outfoxed Soviet spies during the cold war and later thwarted American courts by keeping his granddaughter away from a father whom her mother had accused of sexual abuse, died on Saturday in Bethesda, Md.\n",
      "He was 85.\n",
      "Mr. Morgan, who died at the home of his son Robert, had been living in Auckland, New Zealand, with his wife, Antonia, their daughter, Elizabeth Morgan, and their granddaughter, now known as Ellen Morgan.\n",
      "Anyone who was surprised when Mr. Morgan uprooted himself from retirement in 1987 and spirited his granddaughter away on an international odyssey while her mother spent 25 months in a Washington jail rather than disclose the child's whereabouts did not know much about Mr. Morgan.\n",
      "Growing up poor in Rochester, Willie Mitrano, as he was known, was the boy who delivered the morning newspaper to George Eastman, the industrialist and inventor, even though to claim the prized route he had to sleep on the newspaper steps after staying up till midnight hawking papers on a downtown street corner.\n",
      "After he graduated from the University of Rochester (Phi Beta Kappa, student body president, yearbook business manager) Mr. Morgan, who changed his name to avoid anti-Italian prejudice, worked his way through graduate school at Yale by spending 8 to 12 hours a day lugging 300-pound blocks of ice up tenement stairs.\n",

      "He later parachuted into occupied France to organize guerrilla attacks on the German army and served behind enemy lines fighting the Japanese in China, experiences described in his 1957 book \"The O.S.S. and I.\"  As an original member of the O.S.S.'s successor, the Central Intelligence Agency, after the war, Mr. Morgan, who specialized in selecting and training American spies, helped devise a devilishly effective way of dealing with various war heroes who came highly recommended but lacked the intelligence or sophistication to be spies.\n",
      "After concluding that they would not know they were being used as bait, he sent them to European capitals where real spies watched as Russian counterintelligence agents studied the unwitting decoys.\n",
      "After serving as a psychological strategy specialist with the White House under Harry S. Truman and Dwight Eisenhower, Mr. Morgan, who had worked with children in Rochester and the Bronx before the war, went into private practice with his British-born wife in Merryfield, Va.\n",

      "Mr. Morgan's last adventure began when his daughter accused her former husband, Dr. Eric Foretich, of sexually abusing their young daughter, an accusation he denied.\n",
      "In 1987, after Elizabeth Morgan had failed to persuade the courts to impose what she considered adequate restrictions on Mr. Foretich's visitation rights, the child disappeared, and so did her grandparents.\n",
      "Although the simultaneous disappearances made it clear what had happen, it was not until the girl was discovered living with her grandparents in New Zealand in 1990 that the full story emerged of how Mr. Morgan, drawing on his intelligence training, had taken his wife and granddaughter on an underground escape that included stops in Toronto, Vancouver, Glasgow and London before they found what has proved to be permanent refuge in New Zealand.\n",
      "Their daughter, who served 25 months for contempt until she was freed by a special act of Congress in 1989, has since joined her mother and daughter in New Zealand.\n",

      "Then Chantal Kenol, a director, raised a bullhorn.\n",
      "''We're postponing the start of classes until next week,'' she announced, explaining more repairs were needed and acknowledging this was ''not good news.''\n",
      "Freezing briefly, the students erupted in moans.\n",
      "One voice rang out: ''No, not good news!\n",
      "Not at all, not at all!''\n",
      "A new plan for reforming Haiti's weak educational system envisions a publicly funded network of privately managed schools, similar to what has developed in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina.\n",
      "It calls for subsidies to and accreditation of the nonpublic schools that educate some 82 percent of Haitian students.\n",
      "But, like the College Classique Feminin (known as C.C.F.), many independent schools are in danger of collapsing financially before such a public-private partnership can be realized.\n",
      "They are struggling to reopen and stay open, to rebuild, and to retain student students and teachers.\n",
      "Forty-six years after its founding, C.C.F., a once-elite school catering to lower-middle-class girls who aspire to be the doctors, engineers and teachers of Haiti's future, is fighting for its life.\n",
      "So are many other battered institutions, from hospitals to universities, during this limbo period before reconstructions begins.\n",
      "''You have to be really determined right now,'' said Marie Alice Craft, another C.C.F. director.\n",
      "''If you're not, the whole thing will fall apart, and we can't allow that to happen.\n",
      "The adults are exhausted, but these kids deserve a future.\n",
      "We can't let C.C.F. fail, just like we can't let Haiti fail.''\n",
      "The Need to Reform  In the first week of October, Haiti's reconstruction commission approved a $500 million Inter-American Development Bank project to reconstruct the education sector.\n",
      "That same week, the back-to-school date of Oct.\n",
      "4 proved little more than ''symbolic,'' as Pierre Michel Laguerre, the Education Ministry's director general, put it.\n",
      "With thousands of schools damaged or destroyed, hundreds of temporary replacements were still being built by Unicef, the government, the Digicel Foundation and others.\n",
      "Schools had to be cleared of rubble and of displaced people; families had to scrape together money for uniforms and fees.\n",
      "Neighborhood by neighborhood, students returned gradually to schools that possessed ''the same deficits as before the earthquake -- and then some,'' said Jacky Lumarque, rector of Quisqueya University.\n",
      "Before the earthquake, Haiti's education system was, at worst, inaccessible -- with half the primary school-age children not in school -- and at best ''mediocre,'' as a presidential commission on education said.\n",
      "''Many people called teachers and many places called schools were in fact not,'' said Mohamed Fall, Unicef's education chief here.\n",
      "After the earthquake, longtime advocates for education reform, like Mr. Lumarque, saw an opportunity.\n",
      "From May through July, a presidential commission drafted a $4.2 billion five-year plan for overhauling prekindergarten through university.\n",
      "Previously, the commission had resisted accepting the nonpublic schools as a linchpin, but the moment demanded pragmatism.\n",
      "Creating a traditional public school system ''was not realistic in the short term,'' said Marcelo Cabrol, education chief for the development bank.\n",
      "He recruited Paul G. Vallas, the Louisiana Recovery School District superintendent who has overseen a proliferation of charter schools after Katrina.\n",
      "Haiti's plan calls for subsidizing nonpublic schools to eliminate or reduce tuition.\n",
      "This was happening before the earthquake on a very limited basis, but its reach would expand greatly and the schools would undergo an increasingly rigorous certification process.\n",
      "Also, large disaster-proofed schools would be built, teacher training programs established and the 50-year-old national curriculum modernized.\n",
      "Still, while the development bank has committed to raising $500 million, the $4.2 billion reform plan remains largely unfinanced.\n",
      "This worries those familiar with Haiti's poor record for turning strategic plans into realities.\n",
      "''Right now, we need a series of day-to-day actions to seize the moment,'' Mr. Lumarque said.\n",
      "''But there is no ownership for this plan.\n",
      "Elections are Nov.\n",
      "28, the education minister has packed his bags, donors are in a wait-and-see mode -- and we have a problem with our institutions making it through this year.''\n",
      "Shortly after the Jan.\n",
      "12 earthquake, C.C.F.'s four directors ventured into the heart of Port-au-Prince to find out what had befallen their beloved school.\n",
      "In the nightmarish city center, what they saw at the school gate was heart-stopping: four unattended book bags.\n",
      "They later learned that girls waiting outside for a ride had abandoned the bags and fled to safety.\n",
      "Inside C.C.F., the media center where girls usually waited at the end of the day was crushed.\n",
      "So was the administrative office where Fabienne Rousseau, the director for discipline whom the girls call either ''the red light'' or ''the immigration officer,'' often stayed late to work.\n",
      "The women peered through the gate and trembled.\n",
      "''We stood outside our school yard and cried like children,'' Ms. Craft said.\n",
      "The women, two pairs of sisters, had inherited the school's leadership from their mother and aunt.\n",
      "After surveying the destruction, they drove straight to one of the founder's houses.\n",
      "Elegant and regal with a nimbus of white hair, the founder, Renee Heraux, 77, greeted the women with a home remedy for distress.\n",
      "One by one, she fed them spoonfuls of a sugar cane syrup concoction.\n",
      "Mrs. Heraux had not been willing to check out the damage with her own eyes.\n",
      "''To see an oeuvre of 46 years that was destroyed in a few seconds -- ah, no, that is too much to bear,'' she said, her voice breaking.\n",
      "But she would not let the younger women feel defeated.\n",
      "''We were saying, 'That's it.\n",
      "C.C.F. is no longer,' '' said Djenane Sajous, one of Mrs. Heraux's daughters.\n",
      "''But my mom said, 'C.C.F. is not just a building.\n",
      "It's a spirit.\n",
      "It's a heritage.\n",
      "' ''  In the early 1960s, Mrs. Heraux, a teacher, had a vision for an independent Catholic school for girls -- one that included religious instruction but did not belong to the church, employ nuns or rely on rote memorization.\n",
      "She and her co-founders started with 27 girls -- their daughters and friends' daughters.\n",
      "They opened in a rented house, adding grades yearly until they built a small campus and a reputation for top results on official examinations -- and in competitive volleyball.\n",
      "In the late 1980s, after the Duvalier regime ended, the school, located in a volatile urban zone, began hemorrhaging students.\n",
      "Upper middle class families gravitated to suburban private schools with American or French curriculums; many alumnae declined to send their daughters to the school.\n",
      "In the end, the school adapted.\n",
      "Civil servants, small business owners and families dependent on remittances from abroad, it turned out, coveted the cachet of one of Haiti's finest schools even if the price tag remained relatively elite.\n",
      "''The clientele changed,'' Mrs. Heraux said, ''but the education -- the standards -- remained the same.''\n",
      "Marie Patricia Jean-Gilles, a receptionist at the Ministry of Justice, spends more than a third of her $325 monthly paycheck to send her daughter, Caroline Begein, to C.C.F.  Many Haitian families devote an equivalent chunk of their income to schooling.\n",
      "''Parents are willing to pay for education in Haiti unlike almost anywhere else,'' Mr. Cabrol said.\n",
      "They have little choice.\n",
      "The government spends the equivalent of only 1.5 percent of the gross domestic product on education, compared with almost 5 percent in the region.\n",
      "Choices and Sacrifices  Ms. Jean-Gilles said she was determined to provide Caroline, 15 and in 11th grade, a chance ''to soar above her origins.''\n",
      "She herself did not make it to 11th grade until 22, at which point she got pregnant, dropped out and lost her husband to liver disease.\n",
      "From then on, Ms. Jean Gilles has been singularly devoted to her daughter, sending her to the best school she could find.\n",
      "''In Haiti, if you want something for the future of your children, you have to choose wisely and sacrifice,'' Ms. Jean-Gilles said.\n",
      "''Me alone, I couldn't give her what she's gotten at C.C.F. over the last 10 years.\n",
      "She expresses herself very well, I can say that.\n",
      "People congratulate me.\n",
      "And she wants to be a doctor.''\n",
      "''More precisely, a pediatrician,'' Caroline interjected.\n",
      "A poised, outgoing girl, Caroline has absorbed her mother's faith in education -- ''when you go to school, you tether your head securely to your shoulders,'' Caroline says -- and appreciates her sacrifice.\n",
      "''That's why I work so hard, that's why I don't repeat grades, that's why I have a goal,'' Caroline said.\n",
      "Her goal: ''I plan to put myself at the service of my country and perhaps of humanity.''\n",
      "Caroline and her mother live in a rental home without electricity outside Port-au-Prince.\n",
      "The house withstood the quake, and Caroline, after nights of praying and singing in the streets with less fortunate neighbors, found herself riddled with survivors' guilt: ''I thought, 'Why not me?\n",
      "' Why was I not under the rubble like the others?\n",
      "' ''  In the months that followed, Caroline and her classmates located one another -- all the students in her class had survived -- and found out who was homeless, who was hurt and who was in mourning.\n",
      "When Caroline learned some were being sent abroad, she begged them not to break up the band of sisters.\n",
      "''I called friends saying, 'Please, if you leave, that will ruin everything,' '' Caroline said.\n",
      "''But they had to respect what their parents wanted.''\n",
      "Before school reopened in April, Caroline often accompanied her mother to work, where she used the Internet to look at school photos posted on Facebook by classmates abroad ''in order to remember the way we were,'' she said.\n",
      "Caroline, describing herself on Facebook as ''a teen who adores romanticism,'' Skittles and Eminem, posed a defiant question: ''And what if we all were to get together, forming a strong solidarity based on love and determination .\n",
      ".\n",
      ".\n",
      "Would we not get Haiti back on its feet?''\n",
      "In March C.C.F., its records lost, worked to track down students, one phone call leading to the next and finally to a parents' meeting in the wrecked school yard.\n",
      "Nobody ventured inside to see the startling images: a demolished primary classroom with a teddy bear in clown suit still intact; a tangle of colorful desks violently tossed on a bed of chopped concrete; an assignment from Jan.\n",
      "12 etched on a blackboard.\n",
      "Jean Wener Jacquitte, whose daughter Meghann, 15, died in their collapsed house, attended the meeting partly to revisit one of her favorite places.\n",
      "''I also wanted to tell them in person that Meghann was gone,'' Mr. Jacquitte said, staring at a picture of her on his cellphone.\n",
      "The directors felt overwhelmed by the parents' determination to start over.\n",
      "''With each parent who said, 'Yes, my child is alive, and yes, my child will come back,' we realized we could not close,'' Ms. Rousseau said.\n",
      "''We could not let them down.''\n",
      "Some schools tried to recover fees for the three months when they were closed.\n",
      "C.C.F. did not.\n",
      "As a result, the directors did not pay their staff -- or themselves -- for those months, which upset many teachers.\n",
      "Jeanette Nicaisse, 41, a math teacher there for 25 years, lost her home to the earthquake and gained two new dependents: her mother, whose legs were crushed, and her adult brother, who suffered a disabling head injury.\n",
      "''Obviously, I see the state of the school, and I know they have to spend a lot to fix it,'' Ms. Nicaisse said.\n",
      "''But we all have problems.\n",
      "The teachers were very angry.\n",
      "We have a 12-month contract and it wasn't honored.\n",
      "Now, sometimes, I think, if a better offer came along .\n",
      ".\n",
      ".''\n",
      "In April, the directors gathered the students for a week of group therapy, led by Ms. Craft, a psychologist.\n",
      "In the tents that would serve as their classrooms, the girls stood in circles, clasped hands and reintroduced themselves.\n",
      "''My name is Caroline Begein, and I survived the earthquake of Jan.\n",
      "12,'' began Caroline, who then coaxed a classmate trembling with tears to follow.\n",
      "''My name is Medjina Gene,'' she said, ''and I, too, survived the earthquake of Jan.\n",
      "12.''\n",
      "Medjina, whose mother had been injured and had close relatives killed, was in shaky shape.\n",
      "But the group sessions soothed her, she said: ''They helped me not to cry and to look at things from another perspective -- to have hope, to make new attachments and to let those dear beings I lost remain in my heart.''\n",
      "Sustaining a Legacy  Eight of 18 10th graders, including Caroline and Medjina, had returned.\n",
      "School days were truncated, grades combined and extras like sports and computers were gone.\n",
      "All but one 10th grader passed their state exams in July, and when they parted, they imagined that 11th grade would be the time they finally put the earthquake behind them.\n",
      "In August and September, the directors struggled to find help for expensive demolition and construction work.\n",
      "When the Education Ministry offered no guidance, they used connections to get a government agency to build portable classrooms.\n",
      "The work proceeded slowly, and the directors internalized their anxiety, suffering back aches and chest pains.\n",
      "Things looked bleak.\n",
      "The school had 329 students before the earthquake.\n",
      "By the registration deadline in September, only 19 parents had paid tuition deposits.\n",
      "''I think the earthquake just revealed the cracks that were already there,'' Ms. Kenol said.\n",
      "''Everybody's financial situation was already degraded.\n",
      "Parents were less and less able to pay.\n",
      "We were already thinking that we would need some kind of subsidies.''\n",
      "On that canceled first day of school, the disappointed students regained their equilibrium remarkably fast.\n",
      "After the hardship they had endured since January, this was a minor setback.\n",
      "After classes resumed, the students were thrilled to crawl back inside the school's cocoon.\n",
      "But new issues kept intruding, like hurricanes and epidemics.\n",
      "Caroline, elected class secretary, organized a discussion club.\n",
      "Asked the topics, she said, ''Cholera, cute boys, whatever.''\n",
      "In the final count, some 174 students returned to C.C.F., short of the school's minimum enrollment to make ends meet.\n",
      "The directors began to harbor serious doubts they could sustain the legacy they inherited.\n",
      "Some parents, like Pierre Richard Milfort, said that if C.C.F. did shut down, he might take advantage of his American visa and abandon Haiti.\n",
      "''It would be a signal that everything really is coming undone,'' he said.\n",
      "But Caroline refused to contemplate that her school might die.\n",
      "She put her hand over her ears, said, ''No!\n",
      "Stop!''\n",

      "About eight years ago, at the age of 78, a vascular surgeon in California operated on a woman who then developed a pulmonary embolism.\n",
      "The surgeon did not respond to urgent calls from the nurses, and the woman died.\n",
      "Even after the hospital reported the doctor to the Medical Board of California, he continued to perform operations for four years until the board finally referred him for a competency assessment at the University of California, San Diego.\n",
      "''We did a neuropsychological exam, and it was very abnormal,'' said Dr. William Norcross, director of the physician assessment program there, who did not identify the surgeon.\n",
      "''This surgeon had visual-spatial abnormalities, could not do fine motor movements, could not retain information, and his verbal I.Q. was much lower than you'd expect.''\n",
      "Yet ''no one knew he had a cognitive deficit, and he did not think he had a problem,'' Dr. Norcross continued.\n",
      "The surgeon was asked to surrender his medical license.\n",
      "A fifth of the nation's physicians are over 65, and that proportion is expected to rise.\n",
      "As doctors in the baby boom generation reach 65, many are under increasing financial pressures that make them reluctant to retire.\n",
      "Many doctors, of course, retain their skills and sharpness of mind into their 70s and beyond.\n",
      "But physicians are hardly immune to dementia, Parkinson's disease, stroke and other ills of aging.\n",
      "And some experts warn that there are too few safeguards to protect patients against those who should no longer be practicing.\n",
      "''My guess is that John Q. Public thinks there is some fail-safe mechanism to protect him from incompetent physicians,'' Dr. Norcross said.\n",
      "''There is not.''\n",
      "Often the mechanism does not kick in until a state medical board has found it necessary to discipline a physician.\n",
      "A 2005 study found that the rate of disciplinary action was 6.6 percent for doctors out of medical school 40 years, compared with 1.3 percent for those out only 10 years.\n",
      "In 2006, a study found that in complicated operations, patients' mortality rates were higher when the surgeon was 60 or older, though there was no difference between younger and older doctors in routine operations.\n",
      "Patient advocates note that commercial pilots, who are also responsible for the safety of others, must retire at age 65 and must undergo physical and mental exams every six months starting at 40.\n",
      "Yet ''the profession of medicine has never really had an organized way to measure physician competency,'' said Diane Pinakiewicz, president of the nonprofit National Patient Safety Foundation.\n",
      "''We need to be systematically and comprehensively evaluating physicians on some sort of periodic basis.''\n",
      "Some experts are calling for regular cognitive and physical screening once doctors reach 65 or 70, and a small cadre of hospitals have instituted screening for older physicians.\n",
      "Some specialty boards already require physicians to renew their certification every 7 to 10 years and have toughened recertification requirements.\n",
      "But such policies have met resistance from rank-and-file doctors.\n",
      "''I do not believe that diminished competence attributable solely to age is a significant factor in the underperformance of most poor-performing physicians,'' Dr. Henry Homburger, 64, professor of laboratory medicine at the Mayo Clinic, said by e-mail.\n",
      "Mental illness like depression, substance abuse and a ''failure to maintain competence through continuing education far outweigh age as causes of poor performance, in my opinion,'' he wrote.\n",
      "Others doubt that a single type of exam can be used to assess the performance of doctors from a variety of specialties.\n",
      "''More research is needed for us to define what combination of cognitive and motor issues are important,'' said Dr. Stuart Green, a member of the ethics committee of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons.\n",
      "Physicians do have to meet minimal requirements to continue to practice.\n",
      "To renew a medical license in most states, doctors must complete a certain number of hours of continuing medical education every year or two.\n",
      "This does not impress experts like Dr. Norcross.\n",
      "''You can be asleep during those courses and no one would know,'' he said.\n",
      "Even the tougher new policies of specialty boards do not usually apply to older physicians, who, because of ''grandfather'' clauses, are not required to renew their certification -- an expensive, time-consuming process.\n",
      "They are being encouraged to do so voluntarily, but few do -- less than 1 percent of the 69,000 so-called grandfathered members of the American Board of Internal Medicine, for example.\n",
      "Doctors with mild cognitive impairment may not be aware they have a problem or their performance is flagging.\n",
      "Changes are often subtle at first: a person may not be able to recall words, learn new material, apply knowledge to solving problems or multitask.\n",
      "These deficits can make it hard to carry out the latest recommendations for diagnosis and treatment, learn new computer-based technology, remember prescribing details about medications, or function well in a stressful environment like the emergency room.\n",
      "Only when a doctor's behavior starts to become odd are other physicians, nurses and patients likely to take notice.\n",
      "Medical professionals are supposed to report colleagues' unsafe practices and bad behavior.\n",
      "But doctors are reluctant to confront their fellow physicians, especially their seniors, who may have trained them.\n",
      "''Sometimes we empathize too much and have difficulty making the hard calls when we need to,'' Dr. Norcross said.\n",
      "Doctors often cover for physicians who are becoming less sharp, by having another surgeon in the operating room or by regularly reviewing their cases, Dr. Green said.\n",
      "Dr. John Fromson, associate director of postgraduate medical education at Massachusetts General Hospital, cited a case at another medical center in New England, where physicians noticed cognitive changes in the 77-year-old chairman of internal medicine.\n",
      "He was highly respected and had trained most of the physicians at the center, so they were reluctant to confront him.\n",
      "Instead, they gave him a retirement party, hoping he would take the hint.\n",
      "''But he didn't,'' Dr. Fromson said.\n",
      "''He kept on working.''\n",
      "Dr. Fromson staged an intervention, at which four or five of the doctor's close colleagues confronted him as compassionately as they could.\n",
      "''We reaffirmed our concern and caring for him, and asked him to hand over his medical license,'' he said.\n",
      "''He became quite tearful, but he did.''\n",
      "To lift this burden from peers while protecting patients, 5 percent to 10 percent of hospitals around the country have begun to address the issue of aging physicians more systematically, said Dr. Jonathan Burroughs, a consultant with the Greeley Company, which advises hospitals and health care companies.\n",
      "''The other 90 to 95 percent are not willing to take this on,'' he said.\n",
      "In some instances, their efforts have been squashed by a vocal medical staff.\n",
      "At Driscoll Children's Hospital in Corpus Christi, Tex.\n",
      ", Dr. Karl Serrao, the credentials chairman, decided to move slowly and enlisted the staff's help in drafting a policy for aging physicians.\n",
      "The staff expressed concerns about age discrimination, losing the valuable experience of older physicians and invasion of privacy.\n",
      "Now the hospital's policy states that when doctors 70 and older are up for reappointment, they must undergo cognitive and physical exams that assess skills specific to their specialty.\n",
      "Dr. Burroughs says that screening physicians may be a more compassionate route than doctors think.\n",
      "''By identifying the issue early enough, it enhances their chance of being able to practice longer,'' he said.\n",
      "When a cognitive deficit is discussed openly, the physician's practice can be simplified, he can reduce his patient load, and his partners can regularly monitor and assess his work.\n",
      "''But once something bad happens,'' Dr. Burroughs said, ''he'll get his license taken away.''\n",

      "Mr. ElBaradei, 68, had a fractious relationship with the Bush administration, one so hostile that Bush officials tried to get him removed from his post at the atomic watchdog agency.\n",
      "But as Egypt's powerful Muslim Brotherhood and the secular opposition on the streets of Cairo have increasingly coalesced around Mr. ElBaradei to negotiate on their behalf, the Obama administration is scrambling to figure out whether he is someone with whom the United States can deal.\n",
      "Since the protests in Egypt erupted, Obama administration officials have been trying to reach Mr. ElBaradei, but they had not made contact as of Monday afternoon, a White House official said.\n",
      "''I think that outreach is ongoing,'' said Robert Gibbs, the White House press secretary.\n",
      "Besides both winning Nobel prizes (Mr. ElBaradei won his Peace Prize in 2005), Mr. Obama and Mr. ElBaradei both opposed the war in Iraq, a position that tainted Mr. ElBaradei's relations with the Bush administration.\n",
      "Mr. Obama and Mr. ElBaradei spoke by telephone three times in the fall of 2009, as the nuclear agency director was finishing up his term, and the two men met in September 2009 at the United Nations, where Mr. Obama was hosting a nuclear security summit meeting.\n",
      "They talked about Iran's nuclear ambitions, a White House official said.\n",
      "Diplomatic cables obtained by WikiLeaks showed that Mr. ElBaradei was enthusiastic about Mr. Obama in the early months of his presidency.\n",
      "In April 2009, a cable reported, he told the American representative to the I.A.E.A.\n",
      ", Gregory L. Schulte, that on a recent tour of Latin America ''his message to each government had been to 'help President Obama succeed.\n",
      "' '' He praised Mr. Obama's April 2009 speech in Prague on nuclear disarmament, which had echoed some of his own proposals, declaring ''with a laugh that he could have written it himself.''\n",
      "But now, the biggest questions for the Obama administration are Mr. ElBaradei's views on issues related to Israel, Egypt and the United States.\n",
      "For instance, both the United States and Israel have counted on the Egyptians to enforce their part of the blockade of Gaza, which is controlled by the militant Islamist group Hamas.\n",
      "But in an interview last June with the London-based Al Quds Al-Arabi, Mr. ElBaradei called the Gaza blockade ''a brand of shame on the forehead of every Arab, every Egyptian and every human being.''\n",
      "He called on his government, and on Israel, to end the blockade, which Israeli and Egyptian officials argue is needed to ensure security.\n",
      "During an I.A.E.A.\n",
      "board of governors meeting in June 2009, Mr. ElBaradei clashed sharply with Israel's representative over a Syrian reactor destroyed in an Israeli airstrike in 2007.\n",
      "An American cable from Vienna said that Israel had ignored advice not to criticize Mr. ElBaradei publicly, and he responded in kind, accusing Israel of violating international law.\n",
      "Joseph Cirincione, president of the Ploughshares Fund and a friend of Mr. ElBaradei, said Monday that Mr. ElBaradei wanted Israel to join the Nuclear Nonproliferation Treaty.\n",
      "Israel, along with India and Pakistan, is not a signatory.\n",
      "One senior Obama administration official said that it was not lost on the administration that Mr. ElBaradei's contentious relations with the Bush administration helped explain why he was now being viewed by some as a credible face of the opposition in Egypt.\n",
      "''Ironically, the fact that ElBaradei crossed swords with the Bush administration on Iraq and Iran helps him in Egypt, and God forbid we should do anything to make it seem like we like him,'' said Philip D. Zelikow, former counselor at the State Department during the Bush years.\n",
      "For all of his tangles with the Bush administration, Mr. ElBaradei, an international bureaucrat well known in diplomatic circles, is someone whom the United States can work with, Mr. Zelikow said.\n",
      "However, he allowed, ''Some people in the administration had a jaundiced view of his work.''\n",
      "Among them was John Bolton, the former Bush administration United States ambassador to the United Nations, who routinely clashed with Mr. ElBaradei on Iran.\n",
      "''He is a political dilettante who is excessively pro-Iran,'' he complained.\n",
      "Even some of Mr. ElBaradei's staff members chafed a bit when he softened the edges of I.A.E.A.\n",
      "reports, especially on Iran.\n",
      "They believed he was doing everything he could to avoid giving the Bush administration, or Israel, a reason to launch a military attack on Iran's nuclear facilities.\n",
      "Mr. ElBaradei's term ended early in Mr. Obama's tenure, so any real differences over how to handle Iran never came to a head.\n",
      "And when he left, he said over a dinner that he was enormously admiring of Mr. Obama, chiefly because the new president had adopted much of Mr. ElBaradei's nuclear agenda.\n",
      "When Mr. ElBaradei returned to Egypt for a visit last February, American diplomats observing his reception thought he had some potential to become an anchor for the political opposition, according to diplomatic cables.\n",
      "At the same time, American diplomats underscored the limits of his appeal, saying his ''broader public support remains unclear'' and quoting news reports and members of the ruling party as mocking him as an arrogant outsider.\n",
      "''Many criticized his intention to 'impose conditions' on Egypt from afar and his desire to see the presidency given to him on a 'silver platter,' '' a cable said.\n",

      "WASHINGTON -- When a proposal to encourage end-of-life planning touched off a political storm over ''death panels,'' Democrats dropped it from legislation to overhaul the health care system.\n",
      "But the Obama administration will achieve the same goal by regulation, starting Jan.\n",
      "1.\n",
      "Under the new policy, outlined in a Medicare regulation, the government will pay doctors who advise patients on options for end-of-life care, which may include advance directives to forgo aggressive life-sustaining treatment.\n",
      "Congressional supporters of the new policy, though pleased, have kept quiet.\n",
      "They fear provoking another furor like the one in 2009 when Republicans seized on the idea of end-of-life counseling to argue that the Democrats' bill would allow the government to cut off care for the critically ill.\n",
      "The final version of the health care legislation, signed into law by President Obama in March, authorized Medicare coverage of yearly physical examinations, or wellness visits.\n",
      "The new rule says Medicare will cover ''voluntary advance care planning,'' to discuss end-of-life treatment, as part of the annual visit.\n",
      "Under the rule, doctors can provide information to patients on how to prepare an ''advance directive,'' stating how aggressively they wish to be treated if they are so sick that they cannot make health care decisions for themselves.\n",
      "While the new law does not mention advance care planning, the Obama administration has been able to achieve its policy goal through the regulation-writing process, a strategy that could become more prevalent in the next two years as the president deals with a strengthened Republican opposition in Congress.\n",
      "In this case, the administration said research had shown the value of end-of-life planning.\n",
      "''Advance care planning improves end-of-life care and patient and family satisfaction and reduces stress, anxiety and depression in surviving relatives,'' the administration said in the preamble to the Medicare regulation, quoting research published this year in the British Medical Journal.\n",
      "The administration also cited research by Dr. Stacy M. Fischer, an assistant professor at the University of Colorado School of Medicine, who found that ''end-of-life discussions between doctor and patient help ensure that one gets the care one wants.''\n",
      "In this sense, Dr. Fischer said, such consultations ''protect patient autonomy.''\n",
      "Opponents said the Obama administration was bringing back a procedure that could be used to justify the premature withdrawal of life-sustaining treatment from people with severe illnesses and disabilities.\n",
      "Section 1233 of the bill passed by the House in November 2009 -- but not included in the final legislation -- allowed Medicare to pay for consultations about advance care planning every five years.\n",
      "In contrast, the new rule allows annual discussions as part of the wellness visit.\n",
      "Elizabeth D. Wickham, executive director of LifeTree, which describes itself as ''a pro-life Christian educational ministry,'' said she was concerned that end-of-life counseling would encourage patients to forgo or curtail care, thus hastening death.\n",
      "''The infamous Section 1233 is still alive and kicking,'' Ms. Wickham said.\n",
      "''Patients will lose the ability to control treatments at the end of life.''\n",
      "Several Democratic members of Congress, led by Representative Earl Blumenauer of Oregon and Senator John D. Rockefeller IV of West Virginia, had urged the administration to cover end-of-life planning as a service offered under the Medicare wellness benefit.\n",
      "A national organization of hospice care providers made the same recommendation.\n",
      "Mr. Blumenauer, the author of the original end-of-life proposal, praised the rule as ''a step in the right direction.''\n",
      "''It will give people more control over the care they receive,'' Mr. Blumenauer said in an interview.\n",
      "''It means that doctors and patients can have these conversations in the normal course of business, as part of our health care routine, not as something put off until we are forced to do it.''\n",
      "After learning of the administration's decision, Mr. Blumenauer's office celebrated ''a quiet victory,'' but urged supporters not to crow about it.\n",
      "''While we are very happy with the result, we won't be shouting it from the rooftops because we aren't out of the woods yet,'' Mr. Blumenauer's office said in an e-mail in early November to people working with him on the issue.\n",
      "''This regulation could be modified or reversed, especially if Republican leaders try to use this small provision to perpetuate the 'death panel' myth.''\n",
      "Moreover, the e-mail said: ''We would ask that you not broadcast this accomplishment out to any of your lists, even if they are 'supporters' -- e-mails can too easily be forwarded.''\n",
      "The e-mail continued: ''Thus far, it seems that no press or blogs have discovered it, but we will be keeping a close watch and may be calling on you if we need a rapid, targeted response.\n",
      "The longer this goes unnoticed, the better our chances of keeping it.''\n",
      "In the interview, Mr. Blumenauer said, ''Lies can go viral if people use them for political purposes.''\n",
      "The proposal for Medicare coverage of advance care planning was omitted from the final health care bill because of the uproar over unsubstantiated claims that it would encourage euthanasia.\n",
      "Sarah Palin, the 2008 Republican vice-presidential candidate, and Representative John A. Boehner of Ohio, the House Republican leader, led the criticism in the summer of 2009.\n",
      "Ms. Palin said ''Obama's death panel'' would decide who was worthy of health care.\n",
      "Mr. Boehner, who is in line to become speaker, said, ''This provision may start us down a treacherous path toward government-encouraged euthanasia.''\n",
      "Forced onto the defensive, Mr. Obama said that nothing in the bill would ''pull the plug on grandma.''\n",
      "A recent poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation suggests that the idea of death panels persists.\n",
      "In the September poll, 30 percent of Americans 65 and older said the new health care law allowed a government panel to make decisions about end-of-life care for people on Medicare.\n",
      "The law has no such provision.\n",
      "The new policy is included in a huge Medicare regulation setting payment rates for thousands of services including arthroscopy, mastectomy and X-rays.\n",
      "The rule was issued by Dr. Donald M. Berwick, administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and a longtime advocate for better end-of-life care.\n",
      "''Using unwanted procedures in terminal illness is a form of assault,'' Dr. Berwick has said.\n",
      "''In economic terms, it is waste.\n",
      "Several techniques, including advance directives and involvement of patients and families in decision-making, have been shown to reduce inappropriate care at the end of life, leading to both lower cost and more humane care.''\n",
      "Ellen B. Griffith, a spokeswoman for the Medicare agency, said, ''The final health care reform law has no provision for voluntary advance care planning.''\n",
      "But Ms. Griffith added, under the new rule, such planning ''may be included as an element in both the first and subsequent annual wellness visits, providing an opportunity to periodically review and update the beneficiary's wishes and preferences for his or her medical care.''\n",
      "Mr. Blumenauer and Mr. Rockefeller said that advance directives would help doctors and nurses provide care in keeping with patients' wishes.\n",
      "''Early advance care planning is important because a person's ability to make decisions may diminish over time, and he or she may suddenly lose the capability to participate in health care decisions,'' the lawmakers said in a letter to Dr. Berwick in August.\n",
      "In a recent study of 3,700 people near the end of life, Dr. Maria J. Silveira of the University of Michigan found that many had ''treatable, life-threatening conditions'' but lacked decision-making capacity in their final days.\n",
      "With the new Medicare coverage, doctors can learn a patient's wishes before a crisis occurs.\n",
      "For example, Dr. Silveira said, she might ask a person with heart disease, ''If you have another heart attack and your heart stops beating, would you want us to try to restart it?''\n",
      "A patient dying of emphysema might be asked, ''Do you want to go on a breathing machine for the rest of your life?''\n",
      "And, she said, a patient with incurable cancer might be asked, ''When the time comes, do you want us to use technology to try and delay your death?''\n",

      "The United States, South Korea and Japan are understandably reluctant to get fooled again.\n",
      "But recent events, including the shelling of a South Korean island, have been so alarming that the Obama administration has now decided to nudge the South back to bilateral talks.\n",
      "American officials are also considering their own bilateral dialogue with the North and an eventual return to six-party talks.\n",

      "He promised engagement, tightened sanctions, strengthened regional alliances and waited for the North to return to serious denuclearization talks.\n",
      "The North has only gotten more belligerent.\n",
      "It expelled nuclear monitors, conducted a second nuclear test and ginned up production of nuclear fuel.\n",

      "Seoul has reacted with extraordinary restraint, but the risk of a wider confrontation grows with each incident.\n",
      "American officials say that Chinese leaders have recently tried to get North Korea to back away from confrontation.\n",
      "But how much pressure China -- which fears a collapse of the North above all else -- is prepared to bring is anyone's guess.\n",
      "When President Obama and President Hu Jintao of China meet next week in Washington, this must be one of the top items on their agenda.\n",
      "Mr. Obama will have to forcefully argue the case that an erratic neighbor armed with nuclear weapons is anything but a recipe for the stability Beijing so prizes, or for an American military drawdown in the region.\n",
      "The United States, China, South Korea, Japan and Russia need to vigilantly enforce sanctions on North Korea and find new ways to increase the pressure.\n",
      "It also makes sense to test the North's intentions, so long as Washington and its allies go in with their eyes open.\n",

      "President Bush did not mention it, but the arms control approach he presented today would undo one of the signal accomplishments of his father's administration: the ban on multiple-warhead missiles based on land.\n",
      "Throughout the cold war, it was widely assumed that such missiles were particularly destabilizing weapons.\n",
      "NATO was so worried about the Soviet Union's 10-warhead SS-18 that its code name for the missile was Satan, and Reagan administration hard-liners warned darkly that it would be useful for a surprise strike.\n",
      "Start II, a treaty signed in 1993 by the first Bush administration, banned land-based Mirvs, as the multiple-warhead missiles are known, a move that arms control specialists agreed made the nuclear balance more stable.\n",
      "But the new Bush administration does not see Russia as a nuclear adversary and, officials say, has no interest in rescuing Start II, which has never taken effect because of disputes about conditions attached by both the United States Congress and the Russian parliament.\n",
      "By omitting any mention of Start II, the administration signaled that its strategy is to leapfrog over that agreement and move to a more streamlined arrangement in which the United States and Russia separately announce plans for deep cuts.\n",
      "That means that Start II and its provisions, including the ban on land-based missiles with multiple warheads, becomes an artifact of history, one policymaker said.\n",
      "Administration officials say there is no need to perpetuate a ban hammered out during the tense days of the cold war.\n",
      "Much of the new American deterrent will be based on submarines, making it almost invulnerable to surprise attack.\n",
      "But some arms control proponents are critical.\n",
      "\"It means abandoning one of the most hard fought gains for U.S. national security,\" said Joseph Cirincione, a senior associate at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.\n",
      "\"Multiple warhead missiles are dangerous weapons and will remain in the Russian arsenal long after Putin is gone\".\n",
      "The new administration stance is part of a broad rethinking about arms control that has led the administration to announce reductions in its nuclear arsenal.\n",
      "In considering how deeply to cut America's nuclear arsenal, President Bush faced a quandary.\n",
      "The Russians, whose own nuclear force is shrinking by the day because of economic pressures, wanted the United States to reduce the number of warheads to 1,500.\n",
      "But the United States Strategic Command, which oversees American nuclear forces, had been actively resisting such a deep cut, hoping to keep the level at around 2,250 warheads.\n",
      "Today, Mr. Bush gave them both what they were looking for.\n",
      "With President Vladimir V. Putin by his side, Mr. Bush announced that the United States would cut the number of its warheads to between 1,700 and 2,200 over 10 years, from the current level of more than 6,000.\n",
      "When Mr. Bush took office, he called for a fresh look at the United States' nuclear posture, taking full account of the end of the cold war competition with the Soviets.\n",
      "Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld began a review of the country's nuclear requirements.\n",
      "Still, there was no consensus on how deep the nuclear cuts should go, particularly because of the hawkish views of Adm.\n",
      "Richard W. Mies, the commander of the Strategic Command, who also resisted the push for deep cuts during the Clinton administration.\n",
      "While Bush administration officials insist that their review was driven by a hard-headed look at nuclear requirements, no one was oblivious to the foreign policy implications.\n",
      "A public pledge to slash the number of nuclear arms, officials understood, would help make the case to the Russians, as well as to other Europeans, that the administration's plan to build a missile defense was not part of a drive for strategic dominance.\n",
      "It might even make the Russians more willing to go along with the administration's plans to conduct antimissile tests.\n",
      "These were not permitted by the 1972 Antiballistic Missile Treaty, an accord that is still a bone of contention.\n",
      "The results of this American promise to cut the arsenal to 1,700 to 2,200 warheads over the next decade are significant.\n",
      "It would bring about a two-thirds reduction in the current arsenal.\n",
      "It is also an important advance over Start II, which called for reductions to 3,000 to 3,500 warheads.\n",
      "\"The Bush team are on a positive trend line for the first time toward moving below 2,000 warheads,\" said Rose Gottemoeller, a senior Energy Department official from the Clinton administration.\n",
      "Still, the cuts were not as deep as some arms control advocates would have liked.\n",
      "They are only a little lower than the goals President Clinton and President Boris N. Yeltsin set in 1997 -- 2,000 to 2,500 warheads each.\n",
      "(The Pentagon assumed that American warheads would be on the high end of that range and Russian warheads would be on the low end.\n",
      ")  In outlining the cuts today, the administration also changed how nuclear weapons are counted, excluding those on submarines and bombers that are being overahuled.\n",
      "This will reduce the count by several hundred weapons without actually eliminating them.\n",
      "Still, some of the most important shifts had nothing to do with numbers.\n",
      "In addition to quietly walking away from Start II's ban on land-based multiple warhead missiles, the Bush administration says there is no need for formal treaties on offensive nuclear arms.\n",
      "Instead, the administration's approach is to spell out the reductions the United States is planning while the Russians do the same.\n",
      "The reductions would be verified by provisions for on-site monitoring carried over from Start I, signed in 1991.\n",
      "Administration officials say that dispensing with treaties will enable them to avoid the lengthy process it takes to negotiate them.\n",
      "But critics say it will also leave the two sides without a solid legal undertaking on nuclear arms that would outlast the Bush and Putin administrations.\n",
      "Mr. Putin was skeptical as well, saying he was prepared to codify all of the understandings between the United States and the Russians \"in treaty form\".\n",

      "One of the leading contenders in the race to be City Council speaker, Gifford Miller, picked up endorsements from several labor unions and one of his opponents, Bill Perkins, yesterday as the contest for votes entered its final days.\n",
      "Mr. Miller, who represents much of the Upper East Side of Manhattan, amassed such support -- visibly displayed in a news conference yesterday -- during a busy weekend for the candidates seeking to become leader of the 51-member Council.\n",
      "With the vote set for Wednesday, the last several days have been a whirlwind of swearing-in parties and get-togethers for many of the Council's 38 new members, with many phone calls and meetings among Democratic Party officials, labor leaders and consultants.\n",
      "The speaker and a few heads of committees hold tremendous sway over what -- and who -- comes through the legislative branch.\n",
      "They wield power and influence over lucrative development deals and public programs.\n",
      "Then there are the comfortable jobs within City Hall, made more scarce because an independently financed Republican mayor occupies the west wing.\n",
      "As forces began to coalesce around Mr. Miller, the jockeying for influence began to spill into a more public arena.\n",
      "Possible endorsement deals surfaced, as did more fallout from the bitter ethnic politics of the Democratic mayoral primary, and efforts by labor to wield as much power over the process as the county political organizations had historically, if not more.\n",
      "Labor leaders have cozied up to the Council at a time when they have little relationship with the new mayor and less leverage at the bargaining table because of a weakening economy.\n",
      "Surrounded by members of the city's Central Labor Council, an umbrella group representing hundreds of labor unions, Mr. Miller said: \"This election on Wednesday is not about who gets a good office.\n",
      "What it is about is what kind of an institution are we going to have and what kind of work is that institution going to do on behalf of the working men and women of this city\".\n",
      "But in recent days, the contest has also been about recruiting backers and assessing support.\n",
      "In addition to receiving the backing from the labor council, Mr. Miller also won the support over the weekend of Dennis Rivera, leader of the city's powerful health care workers union, 1199/S.E.I.U.\n",
      "Mr. Perkins, who was at Mr. Miller's news conference, conceded that it became clear that \"the momentum wasn't there\" in his quest to become speaker.\n",
      "His support of Mr. Miller carried with it the votes of four or five council members who had backed him.\n",
      "Mr. Miller's emergence as the leading candidate signaled a developing agreement between the Democratic Party leaders of Queens and the Bronx, people close to the negotiations said.\n",
      "Thomas Manton, Queens Democratic leader, and Roberto Ramirez, the Bronx party leader, met or talked several times over the last few days, several officials said.\n",
      "Mr. Manton said yesterday that most Queens council members would now vote for Mr. Miller, while Mr. Ramirez gave the councilman a warm embrace at an event in Washington Heights.\n",
      "Although Mr. Perkins said that no specific promises were made for his support, he said he assumed he would be provided with a \"leadership\" position when committee chairmanships were doled out.\n",
      "Precisely what that meant was not immediately clear yesterday, but the most powerful Council committees, and those that party leaders have historically cared about most, are Finance, because of its role in negotiating the budget, and Land Use, because of its role in zoning changes and large development projects.\n",
      "Some of those trying to influence the process, as well as one speaker candidate, also touched on the racial and ethnic lines of the race.\n",
      "To that candidate, Angel Rodriguez, selecting a white speaker could bode ill for Democrats, who were divided during the mayor's race and are worrying about the coming race for governor.\n",
      "\"Does the Democratic Party have room at the table for Latino elected officials\"?\n",
      "he asked.\n",
      "\"I think that has to be a concern\".\n",
      "He said yesterday that his candidacy was still viable.\n",
      "He planned to meet with another competitor, Philip Reed, and other council members.\n",
      "The winner needs 26 votes on Wednesday.\n",
      "While the four incumbent councilmen have spent their days stalking the corridors of City Hall, scurrying to holiday parties and inaugural events, and working the phones, others -- Democratic Party chairmen, labor advocates, business leaders, political clubs and council members -- have twisted arms to get votes for their candidates.\n",
      "They were driven by events and interests outside the Council.\n",
      "That was evident in Mr. Miller's endorsement yesterday.\n",
      "Brian M. McLaughlin, president of the Central Labor Council, said that union advocates had wanted to influence the composition of the new Council, and had screened hundreds of Council candidates, then lobbied voters on behalf of about 30.\n",
      "Now his members would encourage council members to vote for Mr. Miller.\n",
      "Although the days when county leaders controlled almost all of their delegations are gone, in part because of term limits and public campaign financing, even reduced influence is enough, consultants said, to allow party leaders to sway the election.\n",
      "Even the freshmen who were elected without the help of their party organizations are hesitant to risk alienating leaders so soon.\n",
      "Many council members won their primary elections with just a fraction of the vote and are insecure about withstanding challenges from candidates backed by county organizations in the next election, which in this case is just two years away because of Council redistricting.\n",
      "There is the prospect that many of the three dozen members tossed out by term limits might try to come back.\n",
      "Then there is the possibility that the party leaders, along with whoever becomes speaker, could influence how Council districts are redrawn.\n",
      "Yesterday, several new members expressed frustration with the influence the party leaders still tried to exert.\n",
      "\"I think it's unfortunate that it was brokered by the party bosses,\" said one new councilman, David Yassky of Brooklyn, echoing sentiment that Mr. Miller's speakership is a foregone conclusion.\n",
      "\"And it will be a test of the Council's independence to see how much we can operate without their influence\".\n",
      "Mr. Yassky said it has become even more important to change the operating rules of the Council to give individual members more power.\n",
      "The Democratic caucus plans to meet again today to address that subject.\n",
      "Some consultants said that Mr. Miller managed to come this far in the race through hard work, especially in wooing the Queens delegation, and by accruing few negatives.\n",
      "For example, Mr. Rodriguez, of Brooklyn, had considerable support in that borough and among the Republicans at first, but he has had a chilly relationship both with organized labor and with Mr. Ramirez.\n",
      "Mr. Perkins had his difficulties too, despite having secured more support among the Harlem leadership than his neighboring councilman, Mr. Reed, with whom he failed to reach an agreement on Friday night.\n",
      "According to several council members, Mr. Perkins encountered opposition from the Queens party leadership.\n",
      "In the end, though, the process has been guided mostly by the desire to climb on board with the winner, council members and advisers said, so the forces involved have been closely monitoring the candidates' chances of winning.\n",
      "There are about 37 leadership positions on the Council, said one official, and nobody wants to be locked out.\n",

      "China's neighbors have acquiesced to Beijing's claims to the airspace above the East China Sea and have stood by as it embarked on a long-term project to militarize the South China Sea.\n",
      "The security balance in Asia is shifting under the weight of a resurgent China.\n",
      "Beijing's belligerence presents an existential threat to Taiwan, a country that Chinese leaders have long vowed to take by force if they deem necessary.\n",
      "For years, the political establishment in Taipei has delegated responsibility for responding to Beijing to the United States.\n",
      "Still, with China's military advances and unchecked assertiveness, we Taiwanese could be headed for a compromise over the fate of our country on China's terms.\n",
      "Whether Taiwan eventually falls to Beijing depends on the choices we make now.\n",
      "Taiwan needs a new approach for its security: The political leadership must correct decades of mismanagement of the military and accept ultimate responsibility for the defense of the country.\n",
      "Taiwan's capitulation to Beijing would not only destroy the way of life for the 23.5 million Taiwanese -- who have become accustomed to personal freedom and democracy -- but it would also harm the interests of the United States and its allies.\n",
      "China would be emboldened to consolidate its claims to the surrounding skies and seas, destabilizing the entire Asia Pacific.\n",
      "With full control of Taiwan, Beijing would gain access to ports and airfields uncomfortably close to Okinawa, where over 20,000 American troops are stationed.\n",
      "Support from the United States has long played a critical role in Taiwan's defense, beginning in 1949 when the Nationalist Party, or Kuomintang, was defeated in the Chinese civil war and retreated to the island.\n",
      "Even after Washington severed formal diplomatic ties with Taipei in favor of the Beijing government in the 1970s as part of the ''one China policy,'' it continued to support Taiwan through arms sales, in accordance with the Taiwan Relations Act.\n",
      "Before our first democratic presidential election in 1996, China launched missiles into our waters to show its disapproval of the leading candidate, who was seen by Beijing as insufficiently supportive of eventual unification of our two countries.\n",
      "To put an end to the intimidation, the Clinton administration dispatched two aircraft-carrier groups into the region.\n",
      "Since that crisis, China has become an economic powerhouse focused on building its military, investing in thousands of ballistic and cruise missiles that can damage Taiwan's ports and runways many times over, neutralizing our navy and air force.\n",
      "These missiles have the range and accuracy to cripple American bases on Okinawa and Guam.\n",
      "This capacity -- combined with a buildup of submarines, ''carrier killer'' missiles and advanced air-defense systems -- has all but ensured that the United States would be reluctant to interfere again on behalf of Taiwan in China's backyard.\n",
      "Taipei's political leadership has failed to address this growing threat.\n",
      "Our leaders have gutted the military and continued to base defense planning on the assumption that the United States would always come to the rescue.\n",
      "Policies put forward by the Kuomintang and the independence-leaning Democratic Progressive Party have left the military understaffed and in a state of low morale.\n",
      "Taiwan has reduced its active force from 400,000 in 1996 to well under 200,000 (the exact number is classified).\n",
      "The nearly two million reservists exist in name only: They are underequipped, not assigned to actual units, and most have not been called up for retraining.\n",
      "We've acquired advanced weapons platforms that are impractical against the threats we face.\n",
      "(For example, we have slow-moving warships and tanks vulnerable to Chinese missiles.\n",
      ") We have neglected logistics and shortfalls in munitions.\n",
      "Training and education have become low priorities.\n",
      "Taiwan also effectively abolished conscription.\n",
      "Since 2000, the leaders have cut the length of mandatory service from two years to just four months and introduced ''alternative services'' to allow young men to fulfill their obligations at civilian ministries and private enterprises.\n",
      "In February, we began an alternative program for competitive video gamers.\n",
      "In March, alternative services were expanded to include trainee positions at chain restaurants and 7-Eleven.\n",
      "We seem to expect American sons and daughters to risk their lives to protect our home, while relieving our own of that very duty.\n",
      "Taiwan's defense policies are largely a result of deep distrust between the military and politicians.\n",
      "The military has struggled with scandals ranging from abuse to graft to espionage.\n",
      "(In November last year, more than 30 retired generals caused a public uproar when they were shown on Chinese state television at a speech in Beijing by the Chinese leader, Xi Jinping.\n",
      ")  It is also burdened by its past as a pillar of the former authoritarian regime: For 40 years, before the democratic transition, the military carried out surveillance of activists and court-martialed dissidents -- many of whom now hold political office.\n",
      "After democratization, military officers went from being feared to being disrespected.\n",
      "Force reductions and pension cuts have further alienated them from the political process.\n",
      "A common refrain among officers is that ''democracy ruined the military.''\n",
      "This mutual suspicion has prevented policy makers from embracing military affairs.\n",
      "The Democratic Progressive Party's landslide victory in the 2016 elections was recognized as a rebuke of the Kuomintang's pro-China policies, yet only one lawmaker in the 113-member Legislature initially signed up to serve on the defense committee.\n",
      "The lack of engagement of our politicians is in contrast to the views of most of the people.\n",
      "In a 2015 survey, 60 percent of respondents agreed that conscription should be reinstated to enhance military strength.\n",
      "In 2016, the support for national service rose to 83 percent.\n",
      "President Tsai Ing-wen and other elected officials must rebuild our armed forces by first restoring the trust between civilian and military leaders.\n",
      "They must also correct the misconception that Taiwan stands no chance against China's military without help from the United States.\n",
      "A country outnumbered and outgunned can still mount a formidable defense with the right strategy, an adaptive military and a hardened population.\n",

      "Every continent save Antarctica is ringed by vast stretches of seagrass, underwater prairies that together cover an area roughly equal to California.\n",
      "Seagrass meadows, among the most endangered ecosystems on Earth, play an outsize role in the health of the oceans.\n",
      "They shelter important fish species, filter pollutants from seawater, and lock up huge amounts of atmosphere-warming carbon.\n",
      "The plants also fight disease, it turns out.\n",
      "A team of scientists reported on Thursday that seagrasses can purge pathogens from the ocean that threaten humans and coral reefs alike.\n",
      "(The first hint came when the scientists were struck with dysentery after diving to coral reefs without neighboring seagrass.\n",
      ")  But the meadows are vanishing at a rate of a football field every 30 minutes.\n",
      "Joleah B. Lamb, a postdoctoral researcher at Cornell University and the lead author of the new study, said she hoped it would help draw attention to their plight.\n",
      "''We call seagrass the ugly stepchild of marine organisms,'' said Dr. Lamb.\n",
      "''They don't get a lot of respect, compared to corals and mangroves.''\n",
      "Seagrass first evolved tens of millions years ago, when some flowering plants moved from land into the ocean.\n",
      "They still grow flowers, pollen and seeds, but they now do so underwater, with a powerful form of photosynthesis that allows them to thrive in dim light at depths of up to 190 feet.\n",
      "The sediment in which they grow is loaded with deadly hydrogen sulfide.\n",
      "They detoxify by pumping some of the oxygen they release during photosynthesis into their roots.\n",
      "With these adaptations, seagrass meadows became more productive than today's fertilized cornfields.\n",
      "As they spread across the planet, the meadows altered the sea floor, building soil and supporting entirely new ecosystems.\n",
      "Animals like manatees and juvenile fish took up residence.\n",
      "''Killer whales are a big tourist attraction, but people probably don't realize that seagrass beds are really important as nurseries for the fish that the salmon require, which the killer whales require,'' said C. Drew Harvell, a marine biologist at Cornell University and senior author of the new study.\n",
      "Humans depend on these nurseries, too.\n",
      "Many of the species harvested in commercial fisheries begin life in seagrass meadows.\n",
      "Without them, fishermen would catch far less, and make less money.\n",
      "In 2014, University of Cambridge researchers studied seagrass meadows in southern Australia to estimate the value they bring to the fisheries industry.\n",
      "They estimate that each acre of seagrass adds about $87,000 per year.\n",
      "The plants also draw fertilizer runoff and other pollutants out of the water, locking them safely away in meadow soil.\n",
      "Scientists have estimated that an acre of seagrass provides more than $11,000 worth of filtering every year.\n",
      "These services alone would make seagrass meadows among the most economically valuable ecosystems on Earth.\n",
      "But now Dr. Harvell, Dr. Lamb and their colleagues have found that these plants may help us in another way: by wiping out pathogens.\n",
      "Their new study, published in the journal Science, began with a scuba diving trip in Indonesia.\n",
      "The scientists were inspecting coral reefs for infections with bacteria and fungi; some reefs are increasingly falling prey to these diseases.\n",
      "''By the end of the four-day workshop, we all came down with amoebic dysentery,'' recalled Dr. Harvell.\n",
      "''One scientist developed typhoid, and we had to ship her out.''\n",
      "The experience left Dr. Harvell wondering if the illnesses of the scientists might somehow be connected to those of the reefs.\n",
      "''It just got me thinking about human health and environmental health and how they're linked,'' she said.\n",
      "She discussed the idea with Dr. Lamb, who began to investigate.\n",
      "Seagrass meadows can release so much oxygen that the surrounding water fizzes like champagne.\n",
      "That oxygen might be able to kill pathogens, Dr. Lamb realized.\n",
      "The plants also host fungi, which are known to producing bacteria-killing compounds.\n",
      "Dr. Lamb and her colleagues decided to study sites around four islands in Indonesia with and without nearby seagrass.\n",
      "The scientists devised two strategies to search for pathogens.\n",
      "In one survey, they collected seawater and put it in petri dishes to see if colonies of disease-causing bacteria known as Enterococcus grew from the samples.\n",
      "Levels of the bacteria in water from seagrass meadows, they found, were a third of the levels in water from other sites.\n",
      "In a second search, the scientists grabbed fragments of DNA floating in seawater.\n",
      "By examining the sequences, they identified 18 kinds of disease-causing bacteria.\n",
      "Water from the seagrass meadows had only half the level of this DNA, compared with water collected at other sites.\n",
      "The scientists next turned their attention to coral reefs around the islands.\n",
      "Reefs next to seagrass meadows, they found, were half as diseased as those without meadows.\n",
      "Thorsten B. Reusch, a marine ecologist at the GEOMAR Helmholtz Center for Ocean Research in Germany who was not involved in the study, called it ''truly fascinating and innovative.''\n",
      "He also warned that ''it remains to be seen what the exact mechanisms of the pathogen removal are.''\n",
      "Dr. Lamb and her colleagues are now searching for those mechanisms.\n",
      "They're also trying to put a number on the value of seagrass's disease-fighting powers.\n",
      "''There could be a huge potential in how valuable they become,'' said Dr. Lamb.\n",
      "Robert J. Orth, a seagrass expert at the Virginia Institute of Marine Science who was not involved in the new report, predicted it would lead to similar research on seagrass meadows in other parts of the world.\n",
      "''It's going to make people think,'' he said.\n",
      "The growing recognition of this plant's importance comes even as it is disappearing.\n",
      "Nearly a third of the world's seagrass meadows have died off since the 19th century.\n",
      "A number of studies indicate that they are now disappearing at an accelerating pace.\n",
      "Last week, Dr. Orth and his colleagues published a detailed study of the retreat of seagrass in Chesapeake Bay in the journal Global Change Biology.\n",
      "Since just 1991, they estimate, 29 percent of the bay's seagrass meadows have vanished.\n",
      "Their research points to two main culprits.\n",
      "Eroded dirt washes into the Chesapeake, making the water cloudy.\n",
      "Seagrass get so little sunlight that the resulting dimming can be deadly.\n",
      "Seagrass is also being pummeled by climate change.\n",
      "Warmer summer temperatures in Chesapeake Bay cause the plants to lose much of their oxygen through their leaves.\n",
      "With less oxygen to pump into their roots, they are poisoned by toxic sediments.\n",
      "The cloudiness of the water makes the heat even worse.\n",
      "With less sunlight, the plants produce even less protective oxygen to begin with.\n",
      "''We have a double whammy,'' said Dr. Orth.\n",
      "As the underwater meadows disappear, economic value disappears with them.\n",
      "The Chesapeake Bay meadows are a nursery for blue crabs, for example.\n",
      "Dr. Orth and his colleagues estimate that the seagrass die-off has eliminated more than 500 million juvenile blue crabs since 1991.\n",
      "Seagrass meadows can store enormous amounts of carbon.\n",
      "Their soils don't decompose because they have very little oxygen in them.\n",
      "As a result, seagrass meadow soil around the world has accumulated an estimated nine billion tons of carbon.\n",
      "As seagrass meadows disappear, that carbon is being released back into the ocean.\n",
      "Some of it may make its way into the atmosphere as heat-trapping carbon dioxide.\n",
      "As dire as the situation has become, there is cause for hope.\n",
      "In recent years, Dr. Orth and his colleagues have successfully restored seagrass meadows off the coast of Virginia.\n",
      "''Now we have 6,200 acres of seagrass,'' he said, ''where in 1997 there wasn't a single blade of grass.''\n",

      "The annual visit of the Vienna Philharmonic to Carnegie Hall, with Franz Welser-Möst conducting three splendid concerts over the weekend, brought bonuses historical, musical and educational.\n",
      "Like the New York Philharmonic, the Vienna is celebrating its 175th anniversary this year, and the two orchestras have assembled a compact joint exhibition of archival documents and photographs, which opened on Feb.\n",
      "22 at the Austrian Cultural Forum in Midtown and will travel to Vienna on March 28.\n",
      "An opening reception at the forum came with music: a performance of Mozart's lovely Clarinet Quintet, with the superb Vienna principal clarinetist Daniel Ottensamer joined by two stellar string players from Vienna and two from New York (the Philharmonic's principal violist, Cynthia Phelps, and principal cellist, Carter Brey).\n",
      "And on Feb.\n",
      "23, three Vienna principals -- Tamás Varga, cellist; Dieter Flury, flutist; and Dietmar Küblböck, trombonist -- led master classes for young alumni of Carnegie's National Youth Orchestra of the United States of America in the hall's Resnick Education Wing.\n",
      "In repertory as in so many other matters, the Vienna Philharmonic follows its own rules and inclinations.\n",
      "It is more likely to stick to time-honored fare than to venture into modernity, let alone contemporaneity.\n",
      "But looming large in the first Carnegie program, on Friday, was a big, burly work only a few years old, ''Time Recycling'' (2012-13) by René Staar, a violinist in the orchestra (he sat out this performance), in its American premiere.\n",
      "In a program note, Mr. Staar describes his goal as an ''interpenetration of past, present and future.''\n",
      "A sort of Varèsian brashness permeates much of the first three of its four sections, a seeming caldron for the fourth, which tosses up an eclectic mix ranging from Perotin in the 13th century to bossa nova in the 20th.\n",
      "The Vienna Philharmonic wind players may be accustomed to playing toy instruments, as they did here, in some of their Strauss family oddments, but to hear the brass players braying on their detached mouthpieces was novel.\n",
      "As an orchestral showpiece, the work was an apt foil to Richard Strauss's ''Ein Heldenleben'' (''A Hero's Life''), and both were resplendently performed.\n",
      "Volkmar Steude, the concertmaster, gave a beguiling solo violin portrayal of ''the hero's companion.''\n",
      "Mr. Welser-Möst, an Austrian and music director of the Cleveland Orchestra, was music director of the Vienna State Opera, where the Philharmonic players populate the pit, from 2010 to 2014, and he and the orchestra seemed wholly at one throughout the evening and throughout the weekend.\n",
      "The other two programs were more lightly spiced with modernity: Saturday's with the dissonant angularity of Bartok's ''Miraculous Mandarin'' Suite (1927) and Sunday's with the supersaturated chromaticism of Schoenberg's ''Verklärte Nacht'' (''Transfigured Night''; 1917, revised 1943).\n",
      "The Schoenberg was stunningly rendered by the Vienna strings: No surprise there, this work being a foundation stone of the Second Viennese School.\n",
      "But nothing was automatic about the Bartok.\n",
      "The Vienna Philharmonic, for whom a lush sonority seems second nature, can sometimes fall short where harshness is needed, but Mr. Welser-Möst maintained a razor-sharp edge of excitement.\n",
      "The pianist Rudolph Buchbinder opened the Saturday concert with an elegant, somewhat understated account of Brahms's muscular First Piano Concerto.\n",
      "And all three programs offered sterling performances of Schubert: the unassuming ''Zauberharfe'' Overture on Friday, the exquisite ''Unfinished'' Symphony on Saturday and the grand Symphony No.\n",
      "9 on Sunday.\n",
      "All three also fell back on the Strauss family for encores.\n",
      "Johann II was represented by ''Frühlingsstimmen'' (''Voices of Spring'') and in Georges Cziffra's Concert Paraphrase on themes from ''Die Fledermaus,'' played by Mr. Buchbinder; Josef Strauss by two polkas: ''Frauenherz'' and ''For Ever.''\n",
      "Happily, to judge from an extended conversation with Helmut Zehetner, a violinist and the vice president of this self-governing orchestra, the ensemble remains committed to social responsibility, so heavily stressed by its last president, Clemens Hellsberg.\n",
      "(Andreas Grossbauer succeeded Mr. Hellsberg in 2014.\n",
      ") It has developed new educational initiatives, and it continues to lay bare the details of its Nazi past, seeking to make restitution.\n",
      "And as for the quantity that always draws attention, the number of female members continues to climb, glacially.\n",
      "It is currently at 11, with four more in the pipeline, as it were, of the State Opera Orchestra.\n",
      "''This is going to be a female profession,'' Mr. Zehetner predicted, startlingly.\n",
      "That, given the present pace of change, is undoubtedly a bridge too far.\n",

      "The misplaced prints had the makings of a book, though such a Warhol-centric concept didn't appeal to Fink.\n",
      "''I said, 'Let's miniaturize -- or at least, equalize -- Andy, and set him in a New York context and inside the actuality of the moment,''' he explains.\n",
      "The resulting ''Fink on Warhol: New York Photographs of the 1960s'' shuffles portraits of the Pop artist and company with other snapshots from the same time period -- of ordinary life and political happenings, like Malcolm X speaking outside Hotel Theresa or the expanse of speck-sized faces at the 1969 Moratorium to End the War in Vietnam.\n",
      "(The latter could easily be part of Fink's recent photo essay from the Women's March on Washington for ''Vanity Fair.''\n",
      ")  He didn't hesitate to package together the two distinct series because, to him, all things are integrated; politics can dominate the conversation and fashion still fits in between the lines.\n",
      "''My mother was a 'Mink Marxist'; she was a member of the Communist party and they'd berate her because she liked to dress up,'' he remembers.\n",
      "''She would say to them, 'Everybody should dress this way -- what's the revolution for?''\n",

      "Israel's chief prosecutor said today that she had concluded her review of the police investigation of the influence-peddling scandal and would announce the results on Sunday.\n",
      "Israeli television said it appeared that neither Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu nor two senior members of his Government would be indicted.\n",
      "The country was left in a state of high suspense as the Sabbath imposed a 24-hour pause in the fierce speculation, maneuvering and questioning that have come since disclosures that the police had recommended bringing charges against Mr. Netanyahu for fraud and breach of faith in the bumbled appointment of an Attorney General in January.\n",
      "The chief prosecutor, State Attorney Edna Arbel, gave no indication of what decision she had reached, except that she had made a \"difficult\" determination on whether to press charges against Mr. Netanyahu.\n",
      "\"The prosecutor's office has enough proof to reach a conclusion and we do not need any more investigation,\" she said, apparently alluding to reports that the police had recommended further interrogation of the Prime Minister.\n",
      "Mrs. Arbel's recommendations now go to Attorney General Elyakim Rubinstein for final approval before they are to be made public on Sunday.\n",
      "Israeli state television reported this evening that the prosecutors would probably bring charges against only one of the four officials named in the police report, and would limit action against Mr. Netanyahu, as well as two members of his Government -- Justice Minister Tzahi Hanegbi and the director general of the Prime Minister's office, Avigdor Lieberman -- to reprimands.\n",
      "In this version, the only indictment would be against Aryeh Deri, the head of the strictly Orthodox Shas Party, who is said to have pressed for the appointment of a lawyer named Roni Bar-On as Attorney General for his own ends, related to Mr. Deri's continuing corruption trial.\n",
      "The police are reported to have recommended a charge of blackmail against Mr. Deri.\n",
      "If the television proves to be right, the reason is likely to be that too many of the police allegations were based on the testimony of one witness, Dan Avi-Yitzhak, who himself had been passed over for Attorney General and was the chief defense lawyer for Mr. Deri.\n",
      "In his covering letter, the investigative unit's head, Sando Mazor, acknowledged this could pose a problem, as the witness -- whom he did not name -- \"might be viewed or presented by the defense as unreliable or even as having vested interest\".\n",
      "Mr. Netanyahu vowed on Thursday that he would fight to stay in office whatever the conclusions of the prosecutors.\n",
      "His lieutenants continued today to criticize the police and the press for leaks and to assail the opposition for trying to overthrow the elected Government.\n",
      "If Mr. Netanyahu were indicted, however, most political analysts agreed he would have to at least take a leave of absence and that his Government could well collapse.\n",
      "A Gallup poll published by the daily newspaper Maariv today found that 52.6 percent of Israelis believed that the Prime Minister should quit if formally charged.\n",

      "Toward the end of his life, Timothy Leary talked of death as the final trip and of outer space as the great new frontier.\n",
      "Today, 10 months after \"de-animating,\" as he called it, he left this planet with a blast, on his next adventure.\n",
      "In a new episode in space travel, not to mention the funeral business, a rocket carrying capsules of his ashes and those of 23 others was launched from a plane after takeoff from Grand Canary Island off the Moroccan coast.\n",
      "The remains, taken aloft in an American Pegasus rocket, will orbit every 90 minutes for perhaps 2 years, perhaps as many as 10.\n",
      "\"I can hear Timothy laughing,\" said Carol Rosin, a friend, who had accompanied the ashes and was observing the liftoff at a Spanish tracking station.\n",
      "\"He would have loved to have seen this\".\n",
      "Mr. Leary, who died last May after decades of surprising and outraging Americans with his advocacy of mind expansion through drug use, finally left this earth in auspicious company.\n",
      "Also aloft in the world's first space funeral were fragments of Gene Roddenberry, who created the \"Star Trek\" television series; Gerard O'Neill, a space physicist, and scientists and pilots.\n",
      "One vial held the remains of a Japanese-American boy, 4, from New York, who his parents said \"loved to talk about the stars\".\n",
      "The official purpose of the rocket, launched from a Lockheed L-1011 airplane, was to put Spain's first satellite into space.\n",
      "But bolted to the rocket's third-stage motor was a canister containing the ashes of the 24 people in aluminum capsules, each one engraved with the person's name and a commemorative phrase.\n",
      "\"They look like little cocaine vials, which is kind of hysterical in Timothy's case,\" Ms. Rosin said.\n",
      "The arrangements were made by Celestis Inc. of Houston.\n",
      "For its \"memorial service in space,\" Celestis charged $4,800 per vial, which includes the fare paid to Orbital Sciences Corporation, the spacecraft's owner.\n",
      "\"We consider these the pioneers, the members of the Founding Flight,\" said Charles Chafer, a co-owner of Celestis.\n",
      "\"These people will open the path for others\".\n",
      "Mr. Chafer, who has long been involved with space projects, said it was unfortunate that all the \"founders,\" however deeply they had been interested in the space program, could only make their journey in death.\n",
      "\"That's all that's possible at the moment,\" he added, \"until space travel becomes normal\".\n",
      "And so it was that those who watched this first-of-a-kind ritual on the site of Spain's National Institute for Space Technology included Spanish generals in uniform, representatives of Celestis in dark suits, video crews and American space technicians, one of whom pronounced the dispatch of ashes into space \"a really neat idea, but my wife wants me in a place where she can visit me\".\n",
      "Among the witnesses was Paula Lamkin of Louisville, Ky.\n",
      ", whose father's ashes were likewise fixed to the rocket.\n",
      "As the spacecraft veered away from the African coast and headed west and a voice announced its entry into orbit, Ms. Lamkin sobbed with relief, causing some consternation among the generals.\n",
      "\"It has taken such a long time to get Dad into space,\" she said of her father, Omer, who died in 1985.\n",
      "That year, after reading about a company that was offering to take ashes into space, Mr. Lamkin told his daughter, \"That is what I want,\" she said.\n",
      "But the company closed.\n",
      "\"My sister and I just didn't know what to do,\" said Ms. Lamkin, explaining that in the meantime she had kept her father's ashes in a safe-deposit box.\n",
      "\"This is it,\" she smiled.\n",
      "\"His soul was already up there, and now I can look up and grin\".\n",
      "Ms. Rosin said she felt \"honored and awed\" that she had been \"able to get a portion of Timothy into space\".\n",
      "In his later years, she said, he was deeply interested not only in \"inner space\" but in the heavens.\n",
      "He said and wrote that like it or not, peoplewould go into outer space and migrate, but that space should be reserved for peaceful purposes.\n",
      "\"I know that's why he called on me, to get him into space and to get his message out,\" said Ms. Rosin, an aerospace defense executive until she became an activist for the peaceful use of space.\n",
      "\"Space was one of the symbols of freedom for him,\" she recalled, describing a moment several weeks before his death when she and Mr. Leary, by then 75 and weak with prostate cancer, were looking at the sky and he blurted out, \"Carol, I want you to get me into space\".\n",
      "Ms. Rosin said she found out about Celestis through friends at NASA.\n",
      "\"When Timothy learned that he would go into space along with other pioneers,\" she said, \"he was so excited he jumped up and down in his wheelchair\".\n",
      "\"He was also thrilled that he would not become space junk,\" said Ms. Rosin.\n",
      "She noted that in its promotional video, Celestis said the rocket's re-entry into Earth's atmosphere would create such friction that the vehicle would burn up.\n",
      "For Mr. Leary, she said, the video reached its high point when it showed a rocket re-entering the atmosphere with a great burst of light.\n",
      "\"That's it\"!\n",
      "he shouted.\n",
      "\"We are all light!\n",
      "We are all light-bearers and we must shine it on others\"!\n",
      "The others whose remains were along on the ride shared Mr. Leary's interest in space, if not all of his ideas about its uses.\n",
      "Mr. O'Neill, the physicist, had wanted his ashes scattered on a space colony, but given the long wait, Mr. Chafer said, his relatives went with this option.\n",
      "Relatives of Mr. Roddenberry, who died in 1991, sent his ashes traveling on a space shuttle, but they were returned to Earth.\n",
      "\"It struck me that all 24 on the flight are men,\" Mr. Chafer said, \"yet most of the contacts or the decisions were made by women.\n",
      "And in one way or another they said that in a spiritual sense this was a great way for their loved ones to join the universe\".\n",

      "When it comes to encouragement, \"I think there's a direct correlation with the number of refrigerator magnets they go home to, and the work they do,\" said Rick Feutz, manager of training for the district's computer program.\n",
      "\"This is just a huge refrigerator magnet, posting their work around the world\".\n",
      "Such access does raise concerns.\n",
      "Wary of cases of criminals finding young victims through the Internet, the district identifies a student only by classroom and first name.\n",

      "Other records, like test scores, are broken down by school, not individually.\n",
      "One teacher, Darlene Bishop, has put her ninth grade social studies curriculum on ancient Egypt on the district's page and even used slides from a recent trip.\n",

      "\"It starts taking the place of books,\" Mr. Keel said, noting that many of the district's textbooks are outdated, still covering the former Yugoslavia, for instance.\n",
      "The Web site, its programming, hardware and related teacher training cost the district $4 million over three years.\n",
      "\"It was costing us big bucks not to do it,\" Mr. Keel said, recalling the time and trouble it took to produce class schedules and report cards without computers.\n",
      "But how many people are able to tap into all this information?\n",
      "Mr. Keel estimates 15 percent to 20 percent of the homes in the district have personal computers.\n",
      "About 2,000 school districts have Web pages, though few have used the Internet to the extent that Kent has.\n",
      "In Orange County, Calif.\n",
      ", the schools have elaborate plans to broaden their computer use.\n",
      "By the fall, the county Department of Education hopes to have a $2.5 million to $3 million program in place for its 450,000 students.\n",
      "Bill Habermehl, the associate superintendent of the Orange County schools, said about 40 percent of the county's homes had personal computers, and Mr. Habermehl said he expected that figure to double when Internet access became available through cable television, for about $300 plus a monthly charge.\n",
      "But only 20 percent to 25 percent of poorer families in the district have cable television, and still fewer have personal computers.\n",
      "\"Shouldn't they be the ones who you most want to be involved\"?\n",
      "Mr. Habermehl asked .\n",
      "One solution, he said, would be to insure that computers and access to school Web sites were available at parents' workplaces or even, eventually, in grocery stores.\n",
      "But exposure to computers has to happen in school, said Gwen Davis, educational technology coordinator with the Orange County Unified School District, \"because some kids will never get it at home\".\n",
      "Ms. Davis envisioned high school students taking their laptops to the library, sending E-mail to teachers and meeting once a week for dinner and Socratic teachings.\n",
      "The school building, she said, could become obsolete.\n",
      "The Orange County system intends to use the same encoding procedures that keep credit cards safe, and will limit parents to viewing their own child's work and progress reports.\n",
      "Testing of the software should begin by the end of this year, Mr. Habermehl said.\n",
      "\"The value to the parents will be just overwhelming, compared to the cost,\" he said.\n",
      "\"Having 24-hour-a-day, 7-day-a-week access to your son or daughter's files, you can be more actively involved in their education from Day 1.\n",
      "Now as a parent you often don't find out if they're not doing well until nine weeks into the semester\".\n",
      "Some teachers give mixed reviews to the new technology, because increased parental involvement usually results in higher student performance, but more work for teachers.\n",
      "\"It's a dilemma, but a manageable dilemma,\" Mr. Habermehl said.\n",
      "Mr. Keel acknowledged that the Internet alone would not solve all of the problems that schools face.\n",

      "''Budget airlines are ideal for a quick vacation or short flights, like one hour to Kuwait or three to Beirut from Dubai,'' said Mr. Maghraby, a media professional who travels once a month on average.\n",
      "''The big carriers win out for longer flights and stays, when factors like extra baggage allowance and roomier seats make a difference; but generally, it's cool to save some cash on the flight for the actual holiday.''\n",
      "When the Middle East's first low-cost carrier, Air Arabia, appeared on the aviation scene exactly 10 years ago, it banked on the notion that price would matter most to many travelers in the region.\n",
      "It was following successful models that took off decades earlier in the United States and Europe, like Southwest Airlines and Ryanair.\n",
      "In 2004, a year after starting operations, Air Arabia managed to break even and almost 10 years later, still showing double-digit growth, it is publicly listed on Dubai's stock exchange.\n",
      "To serve its steadily expanding route network, 10 new Airbus A320 planes will join its fleet next year and 10 more are planned for delivery in 2015, bringing the total to 55 planes.\n",
      "Passengers on low-cost regional carriers, such as Air Asia in the East or JetBlue in the West, are often required to pay extra for things like meals, in-flight entertainment and added baggage allowance.\n",
      "Adel Ali, chief executive and founder of Air Arabia, said in an interview that no-frills flying benefits consumers: It lets travelers decide what and when to eat, for example, rather than being served at a time specified by the airline with only one or two meal options, he said.\n",
      "The same argument applies to entertainment, he added: Passengers often prefer to bring their own gadgets -- iPads, Kindles or DVD players -- to watch what they like, when they like.\n",
      "Consumers put price above all other factors, Mr. Ali said: ''So long as the total cost is cheaper than the fare of another airline, our research showed us that consumers will be happy.''\n",
      "''Our way of giving people choice allows them to be in control of decisions and it also feels like they are traveling in a coffee shop, choosing what to eat or watch on their own time.''\n",
      "He must be doing something right, because demand and competition for low-cost travel have intensified in the Gulf as the region's aviation industry has matured.\n",
      "Since Air Arabia started, successful low-cost carriers, including Kuwait's Jazeera Airways in 2004 and Nas Air in Saudi Arabia in 2007, have been introduced in neighboring countries.\n",
      "Between them, they now cater to millions of travelers a year.\n",
      "While the national carrier Kuwait Airways has lost $1.6 billion since 2008, Jazeera last year extended its streak of profitability.\n",
      "Last month it reported year-to-date net profit at a record 14.1 million Kuwaiti dinars, or nearly $50 million, up 23 percent from the period last year.\n",
      "Alessandro Borgogna, a vice president and aviation expert at the consulting firm Booz & Co. in the United Arab Emirates, said that low-cost air travel in the Middle East had grown steadily, at an average of 20 percent annually, over the last five years.\n",
      "''At the end of the day, it's a volumes game for low-cost airlines -- the more seats you fill, the more money you make,'' Mr. Borgogna said.\n",
      "''The amount of people in the region with medium to low salaries is huge, which has allowed low-cost airlines to grow very fast, especially for destinations like Saudi Arabia and India.''\n",
      "Hybridization of strategy and fleet is taking place as well, which analysts say points to sophistication in the market.\n",
      "Jazeera, for example, offers an eyebrow-raising 40 kilograms, or 88 pounds, of free baggage allowance.\n",
      "The carrier flydubai is going a step further with a new business class section, introduced in September.\n",
      "The 12-seat section on each plane offers meals, in-flight entertainment and reclining seats made of Italian leather: The U.S. carrier JetBlue introduced a similar service this summer.\n",
      "''The decision to start business class services on our flights is an evolution of our passenger offering, based on customer feedback,'' Ghaith Al Ghaith, the chief executive of flydubai, said in an e-mailed statement.\n",
      "''It provides greater choice for passengers, and by challenging the conventions around air travel, we will continue to influence a change in the industry.''\n",
      "Analysts and some competitors say this may be a hint that flydubai is trying to capture a market of low-cost travelers who are still interested in an upgrade.\n",
      "''They are playing with price sensitivity and recognizing that some customers on low-cost carriers would still be willing to pay a premium for better services -- particularly on longer flights -- that is still more affordable than flying with an airline that is not a budget carrier,'' said Aage Duenhaupt, a spokesperson for Lufthansa's operations in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, based in Germany.\n",
      "Even Lufthansa now operates shorter routes, for example, within Germany, through its subsidiary Germanwings.\n",
      "The Dubai government founded flydubai in 2008.\n",
      "The airline now has a fleet of 31 planes and a dedicated terminal at Dubai International Airport.\n",
      "The airline is not affiliated with the legacy carrier Emirates Airlines, though both are wholly owned by a government entity, Investment Corp.\n",
      "of Dubai, and both operate from the Dubai airport, each in its own terminal.\n",
      "Still, many travelers choose not to fly with the low-cost carriers even if given the option.\n",
      "Amena Bakr, a media professional in Dubai, said she preferred to pay a little extra to land in better terminals, secure roomier seats, and enjoy a pillow, a meal, and in-flight entertainment.\n",
      "The extra baggage allowance at no added cost is also a major plus, she said.\n",
      "Similarly, Ramez Kawar, an entrepreneur in Amman, flies with Royal Jordanian to Qatar about once a month, rather than with a low-cost carrier, because he likes the benefits that come from racking up air miles with its loyalty program.\n",
      "''I stick to Royal Jordanian for vacations to Lebanon as well,'' Mr. Kawar said.\n",
      "''I don't like limitations when I travel.''\n",
      "A variety of choices has given depth to the region's aviation industry.\n",
      "''This generates competition, which is always good for the consumer, and in turn, for the industry,'' said Mr. Ali of Air Arabia.\n",
      "''We all compete and want as many people on board as possible, which just stimulates travel and the market share will continue to grow.''\n",

      "WASHINGTON -- My earliest sense of what it meant to be gay in the nation's capital came more than a decade ago when I was a summer intern.\n",
      "I was a few blocks from Union Station when a congressman walked by and gave the reporters I was standing with a big, floppy wave hello.\n",
      "''You know what they say about him,'' said one of them, the inflection of his voice rising to a squeak so there could be no mistaking what he meant.\n",
      "I didn't know, in fact.\n",
      "I wasn't even sure what the congressman's name was.\n",
      "But the message was as clear as it was unsettling for a 20-year-old struggling with his own sexual identity: There were plenty of gay people in Washington, even at the highest levels of government.\n",
      "But instead of being widely accepted, they were usually whispered about derisively, suspect characters to be mocked and maligned.\n",
      "Today, having moved here 10 months ago after six and a half years of living in Manhattan, I hardly recognize that closeted, often intolerant Washington I first glimpsed as a 20-year-old.\n",
      "I now live in the gayest place in America.\n",
      "But don't take my word for it.\n",
      "Consider what surveys by Gallup and the Census Bureau have found about the gay population here.\n",
      "When the District of Columbia is compared with the 50 states, it has the highest percentage of adults who identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual or transgender, according to Gallup.\n",
      "At 10 percent, that is double the percentage in the state that ranks No.\n",
      "2, Hawaii, and nearly triple the overall national average of 3.5 percent.\n",
      "The Census Bureau looked at where the highest percentage of same-sex couple households were and also found that the District of Columbia ranked far higher than the 50 states, with 4 percent.\n",
      "The national average is just under 1 percent.\n",
      "One of my first observations about my new city was the throngs of gay men I would see over the course of a typical day all over town -- walking their dogs in my neighborhood before work, riding the Metro, working in the halls of Congress.\n",
      "I'm not the first to have noticed this change.\n",
      "''There's an openly gay presence that makes you think you're in the Castro or West Hollywood, and it wasn't always the case,'' Robert Raben, an assistant attorney general during the Clinton administration who was one of several openly gay people appointed by President Clinton, told me.\n",
      "''The federal government was a nightmare for homosexuals for decades, and then it wasn't.''\n",
      "Such ubiquity isn't just an abundance of gay bars, though there are at least six within walking distance of my house in the Logan Circle neighborhood of Northwest Washington.\n",
      "On the days I make the 20-minute walk from home to my office near the White House, I will pass one example after another of this city's thriving gay economy: a Mitchell Gold & Bob Williams furniture store; a clothing retailer whose window displays regularly feature bare-torso, well-endowed mannequins in nothing but tiny briefs; three CrossFit gyms; the offices of two gay newspapers, The Washington Blade and Metro Weekly (most cities cannot even sustain one); a bathhouse; and the national headquarters for the Human Rights Campaign.\n",
      "Anyone walking through the Dupont Circle neighborhood the other night would have found themselves fighting for sidewalk space with the hundreds of spectators -- many of them straight -- who had gathered to watch the 17th Street High Heel Race, an annual sprint for drag queens who tear down the block in heels.\n",
      "And when I tried to make plans a few weekends ago, I found most of my friends were booked solid because they were attending one of two huge gay-themed events: the Human Rights Campaign annual black-tie dinner, featuring Jennifer Lopez as the main event; or the Miss Adams Morgan drag pageant, which is such a large production it takes over the Washington Hilton.\n",
      "When our federal district is measured against other cities with large gay populations, a comparison that experts say is better than comparing to states, it still ranks at the top of the list.\n",
      "Gary J. Gates, who studies census data for the Williams Institute at the University of California, Los Angeles, reports that Washington has 18.1 same-sex couples per 1,000 households.\n",
      "That places it eighth among cities with populations larger than 250,000.\n",
      "Sorry, New York, but you have only 8.75 same-sex couples per 1,000 households.\n",
      "In Manhattan alone, it's higher, at 16.7, but still not higher than D.C. The top three are San Francisco (30.3 per 1,000), Seattle (23) and Oakland (21).\n",
      "The numbers capture only those who acknowledge being in a same-sex relationship.\n",
      "Every gay man or lesbian I spoke to for this article had a horror story about what it was like working in the closet, fearing they would be found out.\n",
      "It was only during the Clinton years that the White House finally ended the decades-long practice of denying security clearance to people known to be gay or lesbian.\n",
      "That meant in order to be considered for many high-level jobs involving access to classified information, gays and lesbians had to concoct a web of lies about their personal lives.\n",
      "Steve Elmendorf, a Democratic lobbyist who worked on Capitol Hill for years, described how he and his gay friends had to make sure they all gave the same references to government agents investigating their backgrounds, an insurance policy so that if the question of their sexual orientation came up, they could be certain no one unpredictable would spill the truth.\n",
      "Hilary Rosen, a longtime Democratic lobbyist, told me that in the 1980s she once unsuccessfully tried to persuade Senator Orrin G. Hatch, Republican of Utah, to support a bill that would have given more AIDS-prevention money to San Francisco.\n",
      "''He said to me with much concern and affection, 'Oh, Hilary, why would you want to help those people?\n",
      "' '' she said.\n",
      "''When I told him I was actually one of those people, he shook his head, tried to change the subject and voted against us.''\n",
      "In a sign of how much has changed, she noted, Mr. Hatch recently voted for legislation to include gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender people in federal nondiscrimination law.\n",
      "A spokeswoman for Mr. Hatch said, ''That was then.''\n",
      "Fred Sainz, the vice president for communications and marketing at the Human Rights Campaign, recalled working as a young man for various Republican lawmakers.\n",
      "He was closeted at the time but knew that at least two of the general counsels he worked for and one senior administrator were secretly gay.\n",
      "''It was poisonous to be gay,'' he told me, ''even when applying for a government job.''\n",
      "But it was hardly shameful only in Republican circles.\n",
      "Richard Socarides, a lawyer who was one of President Clinton's openly gay appointees, said that in the early 1990s when he was applying for a job on Capitol Hill in the office of Senator Tom Harkin, Democrat of Iowa, one of the senator's associates said that Mr. Harkin might need to be concerned about hiring Mr. Socarides because of his sexual orientation.\n",
      "Mr. Socarides got the job regardless.\n",
      "Nor was it only political office that compelled you to be closeted.\n",
      "Sean Bugg, executive director of the Next Generation Leadership Foundation and editor emeritus of Metro Weekly, recalled being a reporter covering tax issues on Capitol Hill in 1990 when he bumped into another reporter he recognized at the Dakota Cowgirl, a popular gay bar at the time.\n",
      "''He shot away from me like you wouldn't believe,'' Mr. Bugg said, adding that there was still a sense you were never truly safe being even half-open about being gay back then.\n",
      "''This was the time when the military was still doing surveillance in gay bars.''\n",
      "Such shyness is unheard-of in the D.C. bar scene today, with old stalwarts like JR's, with its one-for-every-taste clientele, and newer additions like Number 9, which can feel like perpetual happy hour for the city's gay political-media complex.\n",
      "Guy Cecil, executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, told me an especially ambitious young man once hunted him down on the dance floor of a local gay bar and handed him his résumé.\n",
      "Apparently he had heard Mr. Cecil went there sometimes on the weekends.\n",
      "While he admired the young man's intrepidness, Mr. Cecil said he did not give him the job.\n",
      "Of course, it's not all utopian for the gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender community here.\n",
      "There are still occasional attacks, like one this summer when a male drag performer was beaten in the heart of what is considered one of the most tolerant neighborhoods.\n",
      "Gays are also no longer ghettoized in one area of Washington.\n",
      "Gradually, they have fanned out from Dupont Circle, which is now full of heterosexual families, all across the city.\n",
      "All of these anecdotes and statistics raise a puzzling question about the District's gay and lesbian population: Why are they all here?\n",
      "They could not have just moved in.\n",
      "Unlike cities like Austin, Tex.\n",
      ", that rank high on the list of same-sex households (No.\n",
      "15), Washington has not experienced a huge population boom in the last decade.\n",
      "One answer seems to be that they have always been here.\n",
      "Gays and lesbians do seem to be drawn to politics in disproportionately high numbers.\n",
      "Mr. Elmendorf told me he thinks that gay people, because they were mostly without children, were able to resist the draw of higher pay in the private sector.\n",
      "''All the straight people would leave, worrying about how they were going to send their kids to Sidwell Friends,'' he said, referring to the elite private school that graduated Chelsea Clinton and currently educates the Obama daughters.\n",
      "The repeal of the military's ''don't ask, don't tell'' policy in 2010 also helped draw more gay people out of the closet.\n",
      "Washington has always had a large military population, many of whom were scared of being too open about who they were until the law changed.\n",
      "As gays and lesbians moved from the recesses of society into the mainstream, few major cities have seen such an obvious impact as Washington.\n",
      "Consider the story of Franklin E. Kameny, a pioneering gay rights activist whose personal history is emblematic of how Washington's acceptance of gays has evolved.\n",
      "A Harvard-trained astronomer with the Army Map Service, Mr. Kameny was fired from his job after being arrested in 1957 by members of the morals division of the city police force.\n",
      "Mr. Kameny sued, filing appeals all the way to the Supreme Court.\n",
      "He lost.\n",
      "But when President Obama signed the repeal of ''don't ask, don't tell,'' he invited Mr. Kameny and sat him in the front row at a White House ceremony.\n",
      "I had the chance to meet Mr. Kameny, who died in 2011, about a year before this occasion.\n",
      "His message then, having just received an official apology for being fired decades earlier, was that gay rights activists had to remember to be patient.\n",
      "Today, a stretch of 17th Street NW, in the heart of the Dupont Circle neighborhood, is named for him.\n",
      "That's where the drag queens hold their Pamplona-like running every year.\n",

      "Charter Communications sought to upend the cable television industry on Monday, offering $37.8 billion to acquire Time Warner Cable, the country's second-largest cable operator.\n",
      "If successful, Charter would take control of a leader in the lucrative business of providing cable television, high-speed Internet and phone services to millions of Americans' homes, placing itself in direct competition with Comcast, the industry leader.\n",
      "But Charter, a smaller cable operator, faces several hurdles in its pursuit of Time Warner Cable.\n",
      "And Time Warner Cable made it clear that it was not interested in doing a deal at that price.\n",
      "By offering $132.50 a share for Time Warner Cable, Charter is essentially matching the current market price.\n",
      "Time Warner Cable shares closed at $132.40 on Monday.\n",
      "Including debt, the offer is valued at $61.3 billion.\n",
      "Moreover, Charter has yet to win over Time Warner Cable's management, or its shareholders.\n",
      "Charter, backed by Liberty Media, owned by the billionaire John C. Malone, has been courting Time Warner Cable for months.\n",
      "But efforts to enter into detailed discussions about a deal have failed.\n",
      "So instead of pursuing negotiations, Charter is taking its case directly to shareholders.\n",
      "It will begin making its case to major owners of Time Warner stock, seeking to persuade them to vote for a deal.\n",
      "It has not started a tender offer for Time Warner Cable shares, however.\n",
      "What is more, Charter faces the possibility that Comcast, the country's largest cable operator, will make an offer of its own for Time Warner Cable.\n",
      "The two companies have had talks about a deal in recent months.\n",
      "''Charter has just put the ball in play,'' said Jim Nail, analyst at Forrester Research.\n",
      "''I would be very surprised not to see someone else come in.''\n",
      "Time Warner Cable said its board had unanimously rejected the proposal, which it called ''grossly inadequate.''\n",
      "''Charter's latest proposal is a nonstarter,'' Robert D. Marcus, Time Warner Cable's chief executive, said in a statement on Monday.\n",
      "''Not only is the nominal valuation far too low, but because a significant portion of the purchase price would be in Charter stock, the actual value delivered to TWC shareholders could be substantially lower, given the valuation, operational and significant balance sheet risks embedded in Charter's stock.''\n",
      "Mr. Marcus went on to say that Time Warner Cable told Charter on Dec.\n",
      "27 that it was open to a deal valued at $160 per share, with $100 of that in cash and the rest in Charter stock.\n",
      "A deal at that price would value Time Warner Cable at $45.7 billion, about 21 percent more than Charter's current offer not including debt.\n",
      "Nonetheless, Charter's bid, which has been expected for months, kicks off a potential round of consolidation in the cable television industry at a time when the cable operators are seeking to increase their bargaining power with the cable and broadcast networks such as Fox, ESPN and CBS.\n",
      "Charter says it believes its offer represents a significant premium.\n",
      "Thomas M. Rutledge, Charter's chief executive, said that after he approached Time Warner Cable about a potential deal last June, the company's shares shot up 40 percent, largely on expectations of a deal.\n",
      "''We think a lot of the premium is already in the stock,'' he said in an interview.\n",
      "Yet even as Time Warner Cable's stock has risen, performance at the company has faltered.\n",
      "It has lost more than 500,000 pay television subscribers in recent quarters, and had mixed results with its Internet and telephone services.\n",
      "''We think the company could be more successful,'' Mr. Rutledge said.\n",
      "Though he would not detail the projected benefits of a deal, Mr. Rutledge said that cost savings from combining sales and customer service functions, plus tax advantages, would make the deal viable.\n",
      "He also took aim at Time Warner Cable's notoriously poor customer service, suggesting it was part of the reason the company has been losing business.\n",
      "''We don't think they need to be losing TV subscribers,'' Mr. Rutledge said.\n",
      "''Turning that around and bringing the other benefits creates value for all shareholders.''\n",
      "A potential deal between Charter and Time Warner Cable, which serves customers from Maine to California, could face scrutiny from antitrust regulators because it would combine two of the biggest cable operators.\n",
      "The two companies do not have many overlapping markets, however, and when counting DirecTV, the satellite television operator as a competitor, ''Charter and Time Warner together are still the third-largest player in the industry,'' Mr. Rutledge said.\n",
      "Antitrust scrutiny would likely be of much greater concern for Comcast should it choose to chime in with an offer.\n",
      "Should Charter go ahead with a deal with Time Warner, it would most likely need to take on substantial debt.\n",
      "The proposed deal is structured as a mix of $83 in cash and $49.50 in Charter stock.\n",
      "Charter said it had fully negotiated financing for the deal, and could quickly sign commitment letters with banks including Band of America-Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse, Deutsche Bank and Goldman Sachs.\n",
      "''There is a substantial amount of debt,'' Mr. Rutledge said.\n",
      "''But we think we can borrow it and de-lever the company relatively quickly.''\n",
      "A combination, he argued, would benefit both Charter shareholders and Time Warner Cable shareholders, who would own about 45 percent of a newly combined company.\n",
      "Charter made its offer in the form of a so-called bear hug letter addressed from Mr. Rutledge and sent to Mr. Marcus, who took over as chief executive of Time Warner Cable at the first of the year.\n",
      "In the letter, Mr. Rutledge alluded to deal talks the two men and their chief financial officers had in December, and to offers made in June and October of last year.\n",
      "But Mr. Rutledge said there appeared to be ''no genuine interest from Time Warner Cable management and board of directors to engage on this opportunity.''\n",
      "Instead, Mr. Rutledge, who took control of Charter in 2012, said his company would begin sounding out Time Warner Cable shareholders to gauge their interest in a deal at the offer price.\n",
      "Though Charter has not made a tender offer for Time Warner Cable shares, Mr. Rutledge did not rule out the possibility of making a hostile bid.\n",
      "Even before Liberty Media invested in Charter last year, Mr. Rutledge said he was interested in striking a deal with Time Warner Cable.\n",
      "But when Liberty, where Mr. Malone is chairman and known as the King of Cable, joined the board, discussions about how to strike a deal intensified.\n",
      "Along with Liberty Media's president and chief executive officer, Gregory B. Maffei, who is also on the Charter board, Mr. Malone supports further consolidation in the cable industry.\n",
      "''John Malone is one of the most experienced investors in the cable industry and Greg is an experienced C.E.O.,'' Mr. Rutledge said.\n",
      "''Having them validate our point of view was a nice thing.''\n",
      "In recent years, broadcast and cable networks have been demanding higher fees from cable operators like Time Warner Cable and Charter for the rights to carry their programming.\n",
      "Spats between the two sides have led to numerous blackouts of popular content, most notably when CBS was unavailable to Time Warner Cable subscribers last year.\n",
      "''Consolidation makes a huge amount of sense,'' said Mr. Nail.\n",
      "''In order for the cable operators to get some clout, they just need to get bigger, so they can have a credible threat of inflicting damage to the networks if they pull their content.\n",
      "It is a good moment to strike.''\n",

      "INDIANAPOLIS -- The ball flew from the arms of Indianapolis running back Donald Brown, and with it, perhaps, went the Colts' season.\n",
      "The ball bounced, though, off the back of an offensive lineman and then, like a trained dog, returned to the feet of quarterback Andrew Luck.\n",
      "He scooped it up, hopped and lunged, arms outstretched, into the end zone for a fourth-quarter touchdown.\n",
      "The score trimmed Kansas City's lead from 28 points only a quarter before to 3, at 41-38, and allowed Luck, on the Colts' next possession, to complete one of the greatest N.F.L. playoff comebacks.\n",
      "With less than five minutes to play, Luck fired a strike to a streaking T. Y. Hilton for a 64-yard touchdown that put the Colts ahead for the first time in the game.\n",
      "With the virtuoso performance from Luck -- and a touch of serendipity -- the Colts recorded an improbable 45-44 victory over the Chiefs at Lucas Oil Stadium on Saturday in an A.F.C. wild-card game.\n",
      "They became the second team in N.F.L. playoff history to overcome a deficit of 28 points and extended the Chiefs' winless stretch in postseason play.\n",
      "''One for the ages,'' Colts Coach Chuck Pagano said.\n",
      "With 13 minutes 39 seconds left in the third quarter, Alex Smith extended the Chiefs' lead to 38-10 on a touchdown pass to Knile Davis, quieting the crowd.\n",

      "''Happy that the coaches, players stuck by me.''\n",

      "A 10-yard touchdown run by Brown helped cut their deficit to 38-17.\n",
      "Robert Mathis stripped Smith to set up the Colts at the Chiefs' 41, and Luck threw a 3-yard touchdown pass to Brown.\n",
      "After a Chiefs field goal, Luck orchestrated another scoring drive, going 80 yards in six plays to close the gap to 41-31.\n",
      "In the fourth quarter, after Luck scored to make it a 3-point game, Smith drove the Chiefs into field-goal territory, and Ryan Succop converted a 43-yarder to stretch their lead to 44-38.\n",

      "On Saturday, in the first playoff game at the stadium since Manning departed for Denver, Luck delivered a performance worthy of the quarterback he replaced.\n",
      "On a fourth-and-11, down to their last chance, the Chiefs decided not to attempt a 61-yard field goal.\n",

      "Charles, who accounted for almost 2,000 yards and 19 touchdowns during the regular season, carried the ball up the middle for 7 yards and took a shot to the head from Jeris Pendleton, sustaining a concussion.\n",

      "For much of Saturday's game, with the Colts nearly unrecognizable against the Chiefs, Smith was the story.\n",
      "He was slippery in the pocket and out of it.\n",
      "He completed two long passes in the first half, the first a 63-yard completion to Bowe on a slant, the second a rainbow heave to Avery for a 79-yard touchdown that put Kansas City ahead, 17-7.\n",
      "The season had been one of redemption for Smith and his first-year coach, Andy Reid, who was banished from Philadelphia after 14 years.\n",
      "Smith lost his starting job with San Francisco last year and watched as Colin Kaepernick led the 49ers to the Super Bowl.\n",
      "This season began with promise as the Chiefs sprinted to a 9-0 record, but they stalled down the stretch, losing five of their last seven in the regular season, including a 23-7 shellacking at home against the Colts in Week 16.\n",

      "Ambrogio Maestri, an Italian baritone whose imposing voice, height and heft have made him one of the leading Falstaffs of the day, is set to give his 200th performance as Sir John Falstaff -- and his first in New York -- when the curtain rises Friday night on the Metropolitan Opera's first new production of Verdi's ''Falstaff'' in nearly 50 years.\n",
      "The milestone is all the more impressive considering that Mr. Maestri is only 43.\n",
      "He first sang the role of the larger-than-life Falstaff -- an elderly, indebted and often inebriated knight -- when he was just 29, at Teatro Alla Scala in Milan, where he was taught the role by the conductor Riccardo Muti.\n",
      "Since then, he has sung it in more than 20 opera houses.\n",
      "''I have grown into Falstaff,'' Mr. Maestri said during a recent interview over a hearty lunch near the opera house, referring not just to his girth but also to his growing appreciation of Falstaff's melancholy, as he has grown older, adding depth to his portrayal of the old knight.\n",
      "The opera, which usually features singing in a tavern, is something of a natural for Mr. Maestri, who got his start singing at his family's restaurant in Pavia, where he worked as a cook and a waiter when he was not singing.\n",
      "Encouraged by the praise of regulars who were also ''loggionisti,'' the opinionated opera buffs of La Scala in nearby Milan, Mr. Maestri began to pursue a professional singing career.\n",
      "Conflating characters with their most famous interpreters can be a tricky business.\n",
      "No one ever goes on about how demonic the world's best Méfistophélès are, or about the sadism of baritones who sing Scarpia in Puccini's ''Tosca.''\n",
      "But there is something about Mr. Maestri's size, good humor and love of food that invariably makes people describe him as ''Falstaffian.''\n",
      "Food may indeed have something to do with it.\n",
      "After he contributed a risotto recipe a few years ago to a cookbook called ''The Opera Cooks,'' people began asking for more.\n",
      "Now Mr. Maestri's website contains not only reviews, the DVDs he appears in, and his forthcoming performances -- but also a series of short cooking videos, with subtitles, that he made and posted on YouTube.\n",
      "One recent recipe is for what Mr. Maestri calls ''cocktail di riso'' (ingredients: Carnaroli rice, shrimp, Pachino tomatoes, peas and extra virgin olive oil).\n",
      "The ease with which he prepares the dish on camera suggests that if Mr. Maestri had not become an opera star, he could have made a popular cooking show host.\n",
      "His operatic career started with help from Plácido Domingo, who gave him the small part of Monterone in a production of Verdi's ''Rigoletto'' at the Washington National Opera in 1999.\n",
      "It really took off after his Falstaff with Mr. Muti.\n",
      "After a recent morning rehearsal at the Met, Mr. Maestri spoke of his life and career over a leisurely lunch: an assortment of charcuterie, prosciutto, gnocchi, a cheese plate and two bottles of Tuscan wine.\n",
      "(It can be difficult to resist ordering that second bottle when dining with a Falstaff.\n",
      ") At one point, when a modest portion of gnocchi arrived, he joked that it looked good -- and that the waiter should feel free to bring along the rest.\n",
      "Speaking in Italian as his wife, Valeria, translated, Mr. Maestri recalled how Mr. Muti had urged him to learn ''Falstaff'' as thoroughly as he knew ''Ave Maria.''\n",
      "''When you can sing it perfectly without thinking, then you can start doing the real 'Falstaff,' and enjoying yourself,'' he said, summing up his instructions from Mr. Muti.\n",
      "''You have to think that you're in your own osteria -- and enjoy.\n",
      "Because if you enjoy, the audience will enjoy, too.\n",
      "And that is everything in 'Falstaff.\n",
      "' ''  These days, Mr. Maestri is in demand from opera houses all over the world; Ms. Maestri said they had spent only around 40 days at home this year.\n",
      "In addition to his Falstaff, he is singing in Puccini's ''Tosca'' and Verdi's ''Nabucco,'' ''Aida'' and ''Simon Boccanegra,'' among others.\n",
      "His performance as Dr. Dulcamara in Donizetti's ''Elisir d'Amore'' at the Met's opening night last year was praised by Anthony Tommasini in The New York Times for its ''dramatic naturalness and stylish bel canto singing.''\n",
      "Still, he is best known for his Falstaff -- he says that the opera character owes more to Verdi than Shakespeare -- a role he has played in all kinds of productions.\n",
      "There was the chamber-size version at the 328-seat Teatro Verdi in Busseto, Italy, in 2001, which attempted to recreate the traditional staging conducted by Toscanini in 1913.\n",
      "There was one in Baden-Baden, Germany: Mr. Maestri said Falstaff's cronies Bardolfo and Pistola reminded him of gangsters from Martin Scorsese's ''Goodfellas.''\n",
      "And last summer, at the Salzburg Festival, he sang in a production that was set in a home for retired singers, in which an aging baritone imagines that he is once again performing his signature role of Falstaff.\n",
      "In a review of that production, Mr. Tommasini wrote in The Times that Mr. Maestri's ''physique is just right for the part, as are his powerful voice, flair for drama and feeling for the Verdi style.''\n",
      "The production coming to the Met on Friday, to celebrate the 200th anniversary of Verdi's birth and to be conducted by James Levine, is by Robert Carsen, who transferred the action to the 1950s, to underscore the opera's themes of a declining aristocracy facing a rising nouveau riche class.\n",
      "It replaces a traditional production by Franco Zeffirelli from 1964.\n",
      "So when Mr. Maestri recently rehearsed the scene in which Falstaff tries to seduce the married Alice Ford but winds up in a laundry basket tossed into the Thames, the setting was dominated by the bright yellow kitchen cabinets of the Fords' postwar kitchen, with a turquoise transistor radio fulfilling the function of the lute that is used in more traditional productions.\n",
      "Mr. Carsen said that Mr. Maestri -- who sang the role when the production was seen earlier at the Royal Opera House in London and at La Scala -- was uniquely suited to the role.\n",
      "''In every respect to do with the role, he is Falstaffian,'' Mr. Carsen said in a telephone interview.\n",
      "''It's just completely his part.''\n",
      "He added that Mr. Maestri could embody not only Falstaff's ebullience but also his underlying sadness and melancholy.\n",
      "Mr. Carsen recalled giving a potluck cast party at his home in London.\n",
      "''The party really only took off when Ambrogio arrived with this enormous risotto that he had cooked in this gigantic tray, with the risotto steaming hot,'' he recalled.\n",
      "''The party started when Falstaff arrived.''\n",
      "Mr. Maestri said that as he has gotten older, he has found Falstaff -- an impecunious knight whose gold-digging efforts to woo a pair of married women end in humiliation -- more sympathetic.\n",
      "''In the end, as the years go by, I see Falstaff as less and less guilty,'' he said.\n",
      "''He doesn't deserve all this.''\n",

      "The British telecommunications giant Vodafone is at a crossroads.\n",
      "On Tuesday, investors will gather in a luxury hotel in central London to approve the $130 billion sale of Vodafone's 45 percent stake in Verizon Wireless to Verizon Communications.\n",
      "The deal -- the largest last year -- signals the end of a foray into the United States that lasted for more than a decade.\n",
      "It also raises questions about the future of Vodafone, which remains one of the world's biggest cellphone operators.\n",
      "As Europe's telecommunications sector faces regulatory uncertainty while continuing to consolidate, analysts are divided over whether Vodafone can prosper on its own or whether it would be better off as a takeover target.\n",
      "That speculation was fueled on Monday after AT&T announced that it was not in talks to buy Vodafone, valued at more than $100 billion.\n",
      "The rumors had been spurred by a meeting last week between AT&T's chief executive, Randall L. Stephenson, and Neelie Kroes, the European commissioner who oversees the Continent's telecommunications sector, during the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.\n",
      "The two discussed AT&T's prospects in Europe, but the meeting also included broader issues like data privacy and the recent revelations in government surveillance, according to a person briefed on the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly.\n",
      "Vodafone's shares fell nearly 4 percent in trading in London on Monday after AT&T's announcement.\n",
      "Spokesmen for Vodafone and AT&T declined to comment.\n",
      "In a brief statement, AT&T added, however, that it reserved the right to make an offer in the future.\n",
      "Under British takeover rules, AT&T, having announced its intentions not to pursue Vodafone, must wait at least six months before announcing any new move.\n",
      "''If an international telecoms company wants to buy anything big in Europe, Vodafone remains the most likely option,'' said Robert Grindle, an analyst at Espírito Santo in London.\n",
      "Mr. Grindle said that Europe's other large carriers, like Orange of France, were partly owned by governments that were not likely to be supportive of a takeover by an international rival.\n",
      "Vodafone shareholders will soon get a glimpse of the company's plans after completing the sale of its stake in Verizon Wireless.\n",
      "As part of the deal, Vodafone has announced that it will return about $84 billion to investors as well as spend roughly $11.5 billion on upgrades to its equipment over the next two years.\n",
      "After outpacing the United States on high-speed mobile networks, Europe has fallen behind the United States over the last five years as large carriers like Verizon and AT&T have invested billions of dollars in so-called fourth-generation wireless infrastructure.\n",
      "In a report last year, GSMA, a telecommunications industry body, said about 20 percent of United States cellphone traffic would be powered by these high-speed networks by the end of 2013, compared with about 2 percent for the European Union.\n",
      "That comes despite consumers' increasing use of their smartphones and other connected devices to gain access to data over carriers' networks.\n",
      "''Growth in data is putting more demands on companies to invest,'' said Tom Phillips, GSMA's chief regulatory officer.\n",
      "In response to customers' appetite for telecommunications services and stiff competition from rival European operators, Vodafone has increased its deal-making to expand its operations into fixed-line and cable services.\n",
      "Last year, Vodafone bought Kabel Deutschland, Germany's largest cable operator, for 7.7 billion euros, or $10.5 billion, to bolster its offerings in the country, which has Europe's largest economy, and compete against rivals like Deutsche Telekom.\n",
      "Vodafone is also in early discussions to acquire the Spanish cable operator ONO, which is considering an initial public offering, according to a person briefed on the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to speak publicly.\n",
      "Analysts said the deal could be worth about $10 billion, though discussions between Vodafone and ONO might not necessarily lead to a deal, the person added.\n",
      "By adding cable to its existing cellphone and fixed-line services, Vodafone is joining other European telecommunications companies in adding complementary offerings to their traditional mobile operations, analysts say.\n",
      "The companies hope that these additional services will keep customers satisfied so that they do not move to competitors that can offer extras like pay-TV and high-speed broadband.\n",
      "''The more services people purchase from a company, the less likely customers will leave for a rival,'' said Steven Hartley, who runs the industry, communications and broadband team at the consulting firm Ovum in London.\n",
      "''Vodafone's legacy has been in mobile, so it's playing catch-up with television and fixed-line services.''\n",
      "European regulators also have called on the Continent's carriers to improve their equipment to jump-start domestic economies, though antitrust authorities have voiced concern that deal-making in the sector may lead to less competition and higher prices for local consumers.\n",
      "Despite the recent takeovers to expand its footprint, Vodafone remains highly dependent on European markets that have yet to rebound from the recent economic crisis, according to industry analysts.\n",
      "After selling its stake in Verizon Wireless, the company also has operations in emerging markets like India and the Middle East.\n",
      "But its core European business still represented almost 70 percent of the company's revenue in the six months through Sept.\n",
      "30, the latest figures available.\n",
      "That reliance on sluggish European economies has led analysts and investors to speculate that the company may be open to a takeover approach from a large international rival that would add Vodafone's European and developing markets operations to its existing global business.\n",
      "''Vodafone is working in a much tougher operational environment,'' said Mr. Grindle of Espírito Santo.\n",
      "''They have found their deal mojo, but only time will tell if the company can survive as an independent entity.''\n",
      "This is a more complete version of the story than the one that appeared in print.\n",

      "The film has already made headlines in recent weeks as relatives of the victims -- as well as the killer, David Berkowitz -- have protested what they say is needless exploitation of the killings, in which Mr. Berkowitz sought out and shot young lovers in cars and women walking dark streets.\n",
      "Mr. Lee has said that his film is about much more than the murders, exploring a time that he has called an \"insane\" episode in New York City's history.\n",
      "The film, which runs 2 hours and 25 minutes, follows the changing lives of a group of young New Yorkers who are brought together and pulled apart by volatile forces: race, shifting attitudes toward sex, the disco craze, the advent of punk rock and seemingly random violence.\n",
      "This may have seemed like ancient history to the giggling teen-agers who sat at the front of the theater yesterday to get the full impact of the pulsing soundtrack and the visual violence that peppers the movie.\n",
      "But most in the audience were older, people who remembered the madness of the serial killings and the other events of that summer.\n",
      "Jimmy Valentino and his wife, Bernadette, took two of their three young boys to the theater to show how life was when they were teen-agers.\n",
      "Mr. Valentino recalled that he was on a Ferris wheel in Coney Island on July 13, 1977, when the blackout hit, and that he nearly cried when Elvis Presley died.\n",
      "\"He died on Aug.\n",
      "16, four days after Berkowitz was captured, and it was the only thing that ever pulled Son of Sam out of the headlines,\" Mr. Valentino recalled.\n",
      "\"All of it seems just like yesterday, even though it's been more than 20 years\".\n",
      "Joseph Petrillo, 46, called that summer the most defining season in his life.\n",
      "\"You were scared to do anything that you were used to doing,\" he said.\n",
      "\"Going to the park?\n",
      "Forget about it.\n",
      "Lovers' lane?\n",
      "Forget about it.\n",
      "Everyone was too scared to even go outside\".\n",
      "Mr. Petrillo and Mrs. Perez each knew one of Mr. Berkowitz's last two victims, 20-year-olds who were shot on the night of July 31 as they sat in a parked car on a quiet street near Dyker Beach Park in the Bath Beach section of Brooklyn.\n",
      "The young woman, Stacy Moskowitz, died of her wounds several days later, while her date, Robert Violante, lost an eye.\n",
      "\"We were especially aware because the killings were taking place around here and Stacy went to my high school,\" said Ms. Perez, 42.\n",
      "Mr. Petrillo said that he still sees Mr. Violante every six or eight months.\n",
      "\"He works at the post office,\" he said, adding, \"I bet he doesn't want to see this\".\n",
      "Mr. Berkowitz, now 46, was sentenced to more than 300 years in prison for killing six people and wounding seven over a period of 13 months.\n",
      "He has said the killings were committed on the orders of a black Labrador retriever owned by a neighbor named Sam.\n",
      "He is now imprisoned in the Sullivan Correctional Facility in the Catskill Mountains.\n",
      "Like so many of the characters in the movie, Mr. Petrillo and Mr. Perez said they, too, had hung out with their friends in 1977 trying to figure out who in their neighborhood might be the killer, taking mental notes of those who seemed less sociable or strange.\n",
      "That awareness and continued fear of the lurking stranger is perhaps Mr. Berkowitz's most lasting effect on them.\n",
      "Now when they park near the shore for a jog or a walk, they may recognize the site of a murder, and if they see a stranger there, they say there is still a split-second when they wonder if he, too, might be a killer.\n",
      "Life just seems more dangerous now, even though crime is down, they said.\n",
      "Mr. Petrillo said he worries about his 17-year-old daughter.\n",
      "\"You've got no control over what happens these days, so I worry about her,\" he said.\n",

      "The Army commander in Kosovo, Col.\n",

      "Nebojsa Pavkovic, intervened to defuse the anger of the women, reservists' wives and mothers who were demanding news of the men.\n",
      "General Pavkovic also commands the Third Army, based in Nis.\n",
      "He met with hundreds of women on Wednesday in two separate and stormy sessions in the Krusevac Town Hall, listening to their complaints and calling the men heroes.\n",
      "At the same time, soldiers began arriving home in army trucks and cars, apparently given permission to return from Kosovo in large numbers, and residents reported that Krusevac was quiet today.\n",
      "The women's main demands had been for new information.\n",
      "Their anxiety turned to terror when the bodies of seven soldiers were brought home for burial last Friday.\n",
      "The women were expecting the men to return after the official announcement on May 9 that troops were being withdrawn from Kosovo.\n",
      "But rumors flew that there had been many casualties, residents said.\n",
      "One woman who attended a meeting with General Pavkovic said the women had asked him to understand that they were not unpatriotic and did not want the army to abandon Kosovo, just that they wanted news.\n",
      "Some were angry and complained that while the men were in Kosovo, rich young men went around town talking on their cellular telephones.\n",
      "Many complaints were based on economic hardship.\n",
      "With the main breadwinners absent, some for 40 days, many women are struggling.\n",
      "The meetings were sometimes heated, but ended with the women applauding the general.\n",
      "One gave him a gift, a sweater.\n",
      "He listened to their complaints, one woman said, and promised that reservists would serve shorter terms and that the men would be relieved.\n",
      "General Pavkovic described the March 1998 class of draftees as \"real heroes\".\n",
      "Those troops should have ended their one-year of service two months ago, but have had their period extended.\n",
      "Some demonstrators in Krusevac were mothers who were protesting the extension.\n",
      "The timely return of some reservists was also probably an army move to defuse the tension.\n",
      "NATO had reported that 500 to 1,000 men had demanded to return home after hearing of the demonstrations.\n",
      "When they were denied permission, NATO officials said, the troops deserted.\n",
      "A spokesman for the governing Socialist Party, Ivica Dacic, dismissed any suggestion that the men were deserters.\n",
      "\"Such a thing exists only at NATO briefings, and they are aimed at undermining national unity and the defense of the country,\" Mr. Dacic said.\n",
      "An army official in Belgrade said, however, that the men had been given permission to go home.\n",
      "Those soldiers who returned clearly did so with permission and little tension, residents said.\n",
      "They stood in groups on village street corners, hugging friends and relatives, said a resident who had traveled by bus through the region.\n",
      "Gunfire sounded through the night and much of the morning, apparently from soldiers who were celebrating the return by firing in the air.\n",
      "The demonstrations have clearly embarrassed local authorities, as has recent violence in Belgrade aimed at the opposition Democratic Party headquarters.\n",
      "Foreign journalists have been denied permission to travel to Krusevac and Aleksandrovac, near the Kosovo border.\n",
      "Several foreign television crews including CBS News and CTV of Canada had film of the damage to the Democratic Party offices confiscated or heavily censored.\n",
      "That General Pavkovic went to talk to the women was a signal of how serious the protests had become.\n",
      "It may also be a sign of his natural charisma.\n",
      "He is the country's most visible general, has frequently appeared on television and has been promoted three times since the beginning of the yearlong Kosovo war.\n",
      "In an interview with a weekly newspaper, Svedok, he warned NATO not to try a ground offensive, because \"hell awaits them\".\n",
      "It was a fierce message to the allies, but it was also a rallying cry to his troops and the people of Serbia.\n",
      "\"Our people and our army are determined to defend Kosovo at any cost,\" General Pavkovic said.\n",
      "NATO \"cannot advance overland without many casualties.\n",
      "Of course, we can count on taking losses, too.\n",
      "But if they come here, they must know that they will not be able to stay and survive.\n",

      "ON a rainy Sunday morning, Deputy Harbormaster Paul Cipolla nudges the Bridgeport 42 out of its slip onto Cedar Creek and heads south through Black Rock Harbor to Long Island Sound.\n",
      "At 10:30 A.M. there are few boats out, but the radar screen shows a nasty tumor of thunderstorms heading from the north; the Coast Guard is broadcasting warnings of heavy rain and high winds, suggesting that boaters seek safe harbor immediately.\n",

      "It's on patrol again, this time in Bridgeport 21, a canopied outboard (the eight boats in the department are identified by \"Bridgeport\" and the hull's length in feet).\n",
      "Although Captain Cipolla has the power of arrest and carries a 9mm Beretta, most of his time is spent stopping boaters, checking their boating safety certificates, flares and life jackets.\n",

      "Back on the Bridgeport 42, the largest rescue vessel on the Sound, according to Captain Cipolla, the two come upon one boat towing in another.\n",
      "They stop and offer a free tow (besides towing disabled boats for nothing, the department will also send a pump boat out to empty vessels' waste tanks free of charge).\n",
      "The powerless boat is headed for neighboring Fairfield, so the 42 stands watch until the Fairfield tow boat, also free, arrives.\n",
      "Finally, around 5 P.M., the unit performs a rescue.\n",
      "Two fishermen on a stone breakwater off Seaside Park have been stranded as the incoming tide covers the sand bar connecting it to the shore.\n",
      "Ms. Weydig hops onto Bridgeport 23, which slowly works its way up to the jagged rocks.\n",
      "Stretching out from the bow, she takes the men's equipment and helps them onto the deck.\n",

      "OF the delight of some and the dismay of others, the largest retail project in 70 years is now under construction on Newbury Street in the historic Back Bay neighborhood of Boston.\n",
      "For years the street has been known for its high-priced, one-of-a-kind retail shops.\n",
      "They occupy the first or second floors of the Victorian-era red-brick row houses that dominate the eight blocks of Newbury Street, from the Public Gardens to Massachusetts Avenue.\n",
      "Now, on the site of a former parking lot, a $14.5 million, four-story, 42,000-square-foot masonry and glass building with parking for 69 cars is being developed by the 200 Newbury Street Corporation, an affiliate of the Boston-based Sawyer Enterprises.\n",
      "Sawyer, an owner of four parking lots downtown, will occupy the top floor of the new building, which is on the corner of Exeter Street.\n",
      "The remaining three stories, with 30,000 square feet of space, will be occupied by a Niketown store.\n",
      "Nike Inc. has opened four Niketown stores since 1991: in Portland, Ore.\n",
      "; Chicago; Costa Mesa, Calif.\n",
      ", and Atlanta.\n",
      "This year, it will open stores in Seattle, Los Angeles and Manhattan.\n",
      "The Manhattan store, with 85,000 square feet of space, will be the largest.\n",
      "In Boston, Nike has taken a long-term lease on undisclosed terms from the developer.\n",
      "Construction of the store, at 200 Newbury Street, began last November, and the opening is expected in the spring.\n",
      "The architect is Childs Bertman Tseckares Inc. of Boston.\n",
      "The building is one of the few new retail buildings to be developed in the city since the collapse of the commercial real estate market in 1990.\n",
      "It also represents a change in Newbury Street's traditional character.\n",
      "\"Newbury street is hot and the whole flavor is changing from small, local boutiques to large chains that can offer landlords more money,\" said Deanna M. Caron, vice president of the Hunneman Real Estate Corporation.\n",
      "\"These companies have long wanted to be here, but the neighborhood association blocked them\".\n",
      "Soon, another national chain, which she declined to name, will lease an existing four-story building there, she said.\n",
      "Chain retailers have moved onto Newbury Street since the late 1980's but have not had the commanding presence that the Niketown store will have.\n",
      "As a relatively large building that will primarily be occupied by one store, it represents a departure and has attracted criticism.\n",
      "Susan Park, president of the Boston Preservation Alliance, said that while the architect tried to make the building sympathetic with its context, it was too big, with too much glass and illumination.\n",
      "\"Most of the retail stores on Newbury Street are small one-of-a-kind stores that occupy 1,000 square feet,\" Ms. Park said.\n",
      "\"This is too big.\n",
      "It's like putting the QE2 on the corner\".\n",
      "Also voicing concern was Susan D. Prindle of the Neighborhood Association of the Back Bay.\n",
      "\"We're concerned that in the long term, the large national retailers who can pay more rent will drive out the smaller merchants,\" she said, \"and Newbury will become a street of restaurants, bars and chain stores\".\n",
      "The architect, Richard J. Bertman, said the building was somewhat smaller than the zoning allowed, and, in terms of lighting, would respect whatever guidelines the neighborhood established.\n",
      "Newbury Street and the entire Back Bay neighborhood were developed for residences in the late 19th century as the tidal flats that surrounded the original city were filled in, said William S. Young, a preservation planner for the city.\n",
      "Of the district's four east-west streets -- Beacon Street with its views of the Charles River, Marlborough Street and Commonwealth Avenue, a wide boulevard -- Newbury was the least fashionable, with residential hotels and apartments.\n",
      "During World War I, retail uses began to appear on Newbury Street.\n",
      "By 1927 with the completion of the Ritz Hotel on Newbury and Arlington Streets facing the Public Garden, a rash of retail shops opened in converted residential space to cater to the hotel's guests, Mr. Young said.\n",
      "During the real estate boom of the 1980's, rents rose, national and international retailers arrived, and the street acquired a cachet as a tourist attraction.\n",
      "In the 1990 recession, rents fell by 25 to 50 percent, depending on the location, to a range of $20 to $50 a square foot.\n",
      "Now the street has about 600,000 square feet of retail space.\n",
      "Over the last year, the amount of space available has fallen to 2.6 percent from 4 percent while the average asking rent has risen to $59.64, Ms. Caron of Hunneman said.\n",

      "When the enormous bomb went off on Tuesday at about 10 P.M., killing 19 American servicemen, Ruth Rosser was making dessert for her husband, Tom.\n",
      "He had worked late at the Saudi company that employs him and provides his housing, in a foreigners' compound called Al Rushaid Village No.\n",
      "3, less than half a mile northeast of the explosion.\n",
      "\"There was a big boom, a tremendous, indescribable sound, and glass was coming down like rain -- we could hear it coming down,\" said Mrs. Rosser, 62, still full of wonder.\n",
      "\"It's amazing no one here was hurt,\" she said.\n",
      "\"But it makes me much more unsettled.\n",
      "The American Consulate puts out warnings, but you think it won't happen here, it won't happen to me.\n",
      "\"In the shops,\" she continued carefully, choosing her words, \"you wonder which Saudis are like us and think like us, and which ones want more of this\".\n",
      "But the Rossers intend to stay here -- where the job and pay are excellent, amenities superb and European vacations common -- \"unless we're ordered to leave, or there are a couple more bombs near us,\" she said.\n",
      "Some of the 35,000 or so civilian Americans living in Saudi Arabia, -- 20,000 of them around Dhahran, are more jittery than the Rossers, especially families with children.\n",
      "This is the largest group of civilian Americans living abroad anywhere, in this country built on oil money where 12 million Saudis have imported 4.5 million foreigners to work for them.\n",
      "The Americans are skilled managers, doctors, nurses, scientists and computer experts, who help run large companies for Saudi owners.\n",
      "They come because of the pay and benefits.\n",
      "As one American said, \"No one stays here, not even the Saudis, for the sunsets\".\n",
      "But beginning with a deadly bomb in Riyadh in November and now with this explosion, more Americans are thinking about how much longer they will stay.\n",
      "\"This changes things,\" said Paul, a 50-year-old banker here who spoke on condition that his surname not be used.\n",
      "\"Of course we're targets.\n",
      "It's easier to focus discontent on outsiders first, and once we're gone, they'll have to face it themselves\".\n",
      "One reason there is less open anxiety, the Americans say, is that most wives and children are away for their long summer vacation.\n",
      "Many Americans here say that in the last few months, they have noticed a significant increase in formality, distance and even hostility toward them among Saudi shopkeepers, especially toward Western women shopping together, even if they are very conservatively dressed, as they must be in Saudi society.\n",
      "Dianne Steen has lived in Saudi Arabia for 19 years with her husband, who works for Aramco, the huge oil company that employs thousands of Americans, and her three children were all born here.\n",
      "\"There's a lot more hostility toward Westerners now,\" she said, describing how, two months ago, she and a small group of women, all wearing hats and loose, long clothing, were not served at a shop in Thuqbah, the old section of Al Khobar.\n",
      "Later, she said, in nearby Dammam, the first five shopkeepers along the main row of shops \"wouldn't even acknowledge us, even though we spoke in Arabic\".\n",
      "She paused.\n",
      "\"That really hurt my feelings.\n",
      "I never, ever had that\".\n",
      "Mrs. Steen thinks the change, based in an increasingly open religious conservatism, has political roots.\n",
      "\"Some of it is having to straddle the fence,\" she said.\n",
      "\"They don't know which way the wind is going to blow.\n",
      "If there's a coup and the King is thrown out, they might suffer for having served Western women\".\n",
      "She described numerous run-ins she and friends have had with the mutawwi, the religious police, who roam Saudi Arabia looking for violations of cultural and religious standards, including inappropriate dress, restaurants or shops open during the period for prayer five times a day, women smoking in public, women driving automobiles, women in public with men not their husbands or brothers, and even women who catch men's eyes.\n",
      "American women have been briefly detained, for instance, for riding in the front seats of taxis next to a male driver, or for wearing tight blue jeans in public.\n",
      "Some American women, like Ann Nahikian, 37, who has been here a few months after living two years in Kuwait, choose to wear the traditional Saudi abaya, or black shawl, in public, to avoid problems.\n",
      "\"It's their custom, and I don't care,\" she said.\n",
      "\"It's a minor thing to me.\n",
      "I have a lot of freedom inside the compound\".\n",
      "Others, like Mrs. Steen and Mrs. Gay, dress conservatively but refuse to wear the abaya.\n",
      "\"It's a measure of oppression to me,\" Mrs. Steen said.\n",
      "\"When I came here 19 years ago, the King said Western women were not required to wear it\".\n",
      "But she noted that in the more conservative capital, Riyadh, \"you better wear an abaya -- it's really serious there\".\n",
      "All the Americans interviewed live in company compounds, walled to keep Western mores inside, hidden from the society at large.\n",
      "They are really villages, with gardens, pools, tennis courts, gyms and sometimes shops.\n",
      "They also have careful security, with visitors checked by guards.\n",
      "Behind the walls, Westerners act and dress much as they please, wearing shorts or even bikinis at the pool, and it is common knowledge that inside these walls alcohol, though banned, is available.\n",
      "Aramco has a series of such compounds, its largest housing thousands of foreigners, including those from Muslim countries, and providing nearly every service.\n",
      "But even in the Aramco compound now, Mrs. Steen said, women must be careful how they dress to go to the compound post office.\n",
      "Mrs. Gay lives in Al Bustan Village, with 220 houses, and the streets have names like Fig, Mimosa and Ash.\n",
      "There are many activities for women and children, she said, from social and card clubs to classes and volunteer work.\n",
      "Local schools end with the ninth grade, and children go abroad for secondary school, usually to American boarding schools, tuition paid by the company.\n",
      "Only a few women are allowed to work, usually as teachers, nurses and doctors, though some work on the compound or with the small American Consulate, and Mrs. Steen founded her own pre-school.\n",
      "Non-Muslim religious services are banned, and whether or not underground Christian services take place is a topic no one wants to discuss.\n",
      "One American described a friend who asked for a cleric just before dying.\n",
      "The family found one who was willing, so long as his involvement was secret: he was smuggled into the hospital.\n",
      "While most Americans interviewed agreed with diplomats that Saudi Arabia is far from being on the verge of revolutionary unrest or upheaval, Tammy Gundy, recently arrived with a daughter and a son, is happy to be heading tomorrow for her two months in America, \"so I can see what happens\".\n",
      "Americans cannot panic, Mrs. Steen said.\n",
      "\"A bomb, it could happen to me,\" she said.\n",
      "\"And if it does, I just hope it happens quickly.\n",
      "But this is my life, and my kids' life.\n",

      "From the window of his small stationery supply store at the Avenue of the Americas and 18th Street in Manhattan, Michael Jacobs saw his world transformed as giant retail stores, one after another, moved into the once vacant and grimy strip of warehouses where he had operated his store since the mid-1970's.\n",
      "The new stores, with their employee uniforms and their emphasis on smiling, suburban-style service and vast selection, changed everything -- the buildings, the neighborhood and, in the end, Mr. Jacobs himself.\n",
      "He recreated his 2,800-square-foot shop in the megastores' image.\n",
      "He bought uniforms and name tags for his employees, and walkie-talkies so they would not have to shout to one another over customers' heads.\n",
      "He began accepting returns.\n",
      "He extended his hours, opened on Sunday for the first time, and last Christmas hired his 14-year-old son, Andrew, as doorman.\n",
      "Every new touch, Mr. Jacobs admits, was borrowed from the bigger players across the avenue.\n",
      "\"I made it into the 20th century by following these other stores,\" Mr. Jacobs said.\n",
      "\"It's like going to college for getting the customer in your store -- you have to pick up and steal these little ideas\".\n",
      "In a region where the arrogant sales clerk and the sky-high utility bill are stock symbols of the economic landscape, greater consumer choice is breaking out all over, or is poised to.\n",
      "Some of the effects may not be positive -- more competition, consumer experts say, probably means more business failures, for one thing.\n",
      "But as Mr. Jacobs's story shows, a new wave of competition is empowering customers to demand better treatment, and businesses from telephone companies to grocery stores are giving it.\n",
      "\"It means getting at eye-to-eye level with the customer,\" said Stan Sorkin, a vice president of Pathmark Stores, which operates 17 suburban-style supermarkets in New York City and plans to open eight more in the next five years.\n",
      "Mr. Sorkin takes the eye-level idea literally: the customer-service booths in Pathmark stores have all been lowered by 18 inches, so that shoppers do not feel looked down upon.\n",
      "The economy in the New York area, and particularly the city itself, has traditionally had a split personality: poor service, limited selection and high prices, especially in poorer neighborhoods, coexist with encyclopedic choices in other areas, like home delivery of expensive foods.\n",
      "A kind of island economy mentality, with expectations of scarcity amid plenty, has been reinforced by habit, politics, high taxes and land prices, and zoning regulations that city officials and business people say inhibited the entry of competitors.\n",
      "The new pattern of consumer choice has been spurred partly by Government deregulation and technological innovation, but it is mostly the result of old-fashioned competition, as companies that once avoided New York have declared its barricades worth surmounting.\n",
      "Last year, Wal-Mart came to the New York region for the first time, opening two huge discount stores on Long Island.\n",
      "Office Depot entered as well, opening three of the four largest stores in its national chain in New Jersey and Long Island.\n",
      "The Old Navy Clothing Company came to the Avenue of the Americas, and plans to open stores in the Bronx and Brooklyn later this year.\n",
      "Fairway brought supermarket-scale shopping to Harlem.\n",

      ", selling natural gas under utility competition rules that took effect in New York State on May 1.\n",
      "Orange and Rockland Utilities plans to begin a pilot program this summer to let customers choose their electricity supplier.\n",
      "Nynex, which consumer groups say has one of the worst telephone service records in the nation, is merging with Bell Atlantic, which has one of the best.\n",
      "More Choices, More Demands  Experts say that consumer choice, once established, tends to be self-perpetuating, attracting new customers while raising the expectations of old ones.\n",
      "That in turn puts pressure on businesses to keep up with their customers' demands, as well as with one another.\n",
      "\"Consumers have a higher expectation of what companies are going to do for them,\" said Jerry DeSanto, director of information and investigations at the Better Business Bureau of Metropolitan New York.\n",
      "\"If you walk into a Gap, you assume you're going to get good treatment, and the competition is so fierce for your dollar, that if you go anywhere else, they'd better be as good\".\n",
      "New competitors say that businesses in New York have generally been slower than elsewhere in responding to consumers' changing demands.\n",
      "That spelled opportunity.\n",
      "\"Stores became more customer friendly elsewhere in the country, and as that gap widened, it made it more appealing to come here,\" said Don Sussman, the vice president and general manager of the Long Island-New Jersey division for the Stop and Shop Supermarket Company.\n",
      "Stop and Shop, based in Massachusetts, bought a 17-store Mel's Food Town chain on Long Island last year, and is now building its first four new stores in the region, all on Long Island.\n",
      "Some of the bigger established businesses in the city have bent with the winds.\n",
      "Macy's and Lord & Taylor have liberalized their return and exchange policies since the late 1980's, either by extending time limits for returns or eliminating the restrictions altogether, according to surveys by the Better Business Bureau.\n",
      "Companies also say that keeping up with consumers does not simply mean being nicer.\n",
      "In many cases better customer service means materially different service.\n",
      "The new Pathmark stores, for example, will all feature lines of prepared meals to reheat at home.\n",
      "And a Wal-Mart spokesman said that getting customers out of the store without long waits has become as important as attracting them.\n",
      "Mr. Jacobs has found that shoppers lured from outside the neighborhood and even the suburbs to what was known as the Ladies' Mile are different from the local customers that his store, Jam Paper and Envelope, once depended on.\n",
      "Because they do not live nearby, they will come back only if they want to.\n",
      "That changes everything.\n",
      "\"You only get one crack at them,\" Mr. Jacobs said.\n",
      "\"If you want them back, you've got to make them happy\".\n",
      "No Guarantees Of Survival  But the expanding menu in the region does not guarantee a world of sweetness and light.\n",
      "Better service or not, some businesses in the region will undoubtedly fail.\n",
      "And some, like the deli and variety store that were on Mr. Jacobs's block, will be physically displaced by new merchants.\n",
      "Others simply might not find a way to compete in the new era.\n",
      "And for some businesses, like utilities and telecommunications, experts say the picture is still developing.\n",
      "With the passage of the Federal Telecommunications Act, heightened competition among telephone companies is expected to drive down long-distance rates.\n",
      "But local service rates are generally expected to go up, and the result may be a wash.\n",
      "The merger of Nynex and Bell Atlantic, while holding the promise of better service for Nynex customers, also represents a net decrease in competition, making consumer experts cautious about the long-term benefits.\n",
      "\"If you're a Nynex customer, the grass is always greener wherever you go, but I'd much rather see Bell Atlantic coming in and competing,\" said Robert Ceisler, executive director of the New York Citizens Utility Board, a nonprofit consumer group.\n",
      "\"Everyone's talking about competing, but merging with another Baby Bell is not competition\".\n",
      "Utility deregulation, which is progressing in all three states in the region -- fastest in New York -- is expected to help mainly big business users of electricity in the early years.\n",
      "Utility experts say residents should expect lots of new choices in coming years, as utilities try to repackage and customize their services -- combining, perhaps, telephone, cable television and electric or gas service on a single bill.\n",
      "But they say rates could remain stubbornly high, or even go up.\n",
      "Competitive markets mean greater business risks, which mean higher capital borrowing costs.\n",
      "Analysts say those costs could postpone or eliminate rate reductions.\n",
      "Residents of the New York region -- especially customers of the Long Island Lighting Company, Con Edison and Orange and Rockland Utilities -- already pay some of the highest energy rates in the nation, according to Georgetown Consulting, a Connecticut firm that works with local regulators.\n",
      "\"I think you are going to see the utilities try to get closer to customers and try to provide better service, but it will be the larger customers first,\" said Michael D. Dirmeier of the Georgetown firm.\n",
      "The New Dynamic Takes Hold  Still, there are clear indicators that the new dynamic of competition is taking hold, bringing economic growth and improved service.\n",
      "Total retail sales rose in New York City in 1995, after falling steadily since 1988, according to figures from the Department of City Planning.\n",
      "Retail sales outside the city declined.\n",
      "Both changes were slight, but the implications are profound -- the first time such a pattern has emerged since at least 1982, city officials said.\n",
      "The administration of Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani is now pushing a revised zoning plan intended to keep that momentum going by encouraging new retail uses in manufacturing zones.\n",
      "In another sign of change, about 2,000 new jobs are expected from the new generation of huge Pathmark stores.\n",
      "It is the company's first expansion in the city since 1988.\n",
      "And in Harlem, where Fairway Market opened earlier this year at 133d Street and 12th Avenue, smaller groceries at first howled that the new store would drive them out of business.\n",
      "But in the world after Fairway, local stores are becoming better, cleaner and cheaper to win back shoppers.\n",
      "\"Fairway is showing that there is the capacity in low-income neighborhoods to support good food stores, and that's putting pressure on the stores in the neighborhood to begin to serve the consumer better -- prices have been affected,\" said Pamela Fairclough, a project manager at the Community Food Resource Center, a nonprofit group.\n",
      "\"I think those operators are kind of realizing that they kind of have to get their acts together\".\n",
      "In Stamford, the 12 employees of Keyspan Energy provide further evidence of competition-fueled growth.\n",
      "The company began advertising for the first time last month on radio and in newspapers, urging customers to rethink their natural gas supplier.\n",
      "Under deregulation, consumers can buy gas from whatever company they want at whatever price they can negotiate without changing the utility that actually delivers the service to their house or business.\n",
      "Keyspan is also an example of the surprising turns that the competition can take.\n",
      "The company is a subsidiary of Brooklyn Union Gas, but part of its mandate is to woo customers away from its own parent.\n",
      "Brooklyn Union officials say it is an arrangement in which everybody can come out ahead: Keyspan buys the gas more cheaply than Brooklyn Union can because it pays lower Connecticut taxes; the savings is passed on to the customer; Brooklyn Union, which makes its profit on the actual delivery system anyway, and not the gas itself, makes its customers happy.\n",
      "Orange and Rockland Utilities also plans to offer industrial customers the option, beginning July 1, of buying their electricity from another source.\n",
      "The pilot program will be extended to some residential customers next January.\n",
      "On a smaller scale, competition has created new jobs at Mr. Jacobs'slittle empire, Jam Paper and Envelope.\n",
      "He hired two employees when he expanded his hours.\n",
      "And then he implemented all the changes inspired on the Avenue of the Americas -- from uniforms to shopping baskets handed out at the front door -- to his two other Manhattan stores.\n",
      "His workforce has expanded by 6, to 26.\n",
      "And the improvements, he said, build on one another.\n",
      "He encourages his employees to become spies on their lunch hours, scouting out the newest customer-service techniques in the big stores.\n",
      "When an idea is tried out, he said, the employees appreciate getting more attention, and feel they have made a contribution.\n",

      "Inmates on Rikers Island attacked correction officers searching for contraband yesterday, injuring 20 of them, in the second scuffle in the jail complex this week, officials said.\n",
      "The guards, whose injuries were mostly cuts and bruises, were taken to Western Queens Community Hospital and St. John's Hospital, where they were treated and released, said Thomas Antenen, a spokesman for the city's Department of Correction.\n",
      "Three inmates were treated for minor injuries at Elmhurst Hospital Center, he said.\n",
      "The skirmish began at 3:45 P.M. at the George Motchan Detention Center, a medium security area, when the officers arrived in the dormitorylike cell to conduct a routine search, Mr. Antenen said.\n",
      "The inmates resisted.\n",
      "One slashed two captains with a makeshift knife and others hit officers with chairs and other objects, he said.\n",
      "Late yesterday, officials were still trying to determine how many of the 45 inmates in the cell were involved in the fight.\n",
      "Norman Seabrook, a spokesman for the correction officers union, complained that budget cuts were hampering the officers' ability to do their jobs.\n",

      "The bipartisan Federal Election Commission sued the Christian Coalition today, asserting that the nation's largest group of religious conservatives had acted illegally to promote several Republican candidates, including former President George Bush, Speaker Newt Gingrich, Senator Jesse Helms and Oliver L. North.\n",
      "In a civil suit filed in Federal District Court here, the election commission argued that the coalition's nonpartisan posture was a sham and that it had used voter guides, mailings and telephone banks to press for the election of particular Republican candidates in 1990, 1992 and 1994.\n",
      "The money the coalition channeled into these activities amounted to illegal donations, the commission said, and those contributions should have been reported as independent expenditures or as in-kind contributions to those campaigns.\n",
      "In a statement, the Christian Coalition, founded by the evangelist Pat Robertson after his unsuccessful bid for the Republican Presidential nomination in 1988, called the suit \"totally baseless\" and \"frivolous\".\n",
      "\"We are absolutely and totally confident that we will be fully vindicated,\" said Ralph Reed, the group's executive director, \"and the courts will affirm that people of faith have every right to be involved as citizens and voters\".\n",
      "But it may be difficult for the coalition to dismiss the suit as politically driven because two Republicans joined two Democrats in voting on May 7 to sue.\n",
      "The Republicans were Lee Ann Elliott, the F.E.C. chairwoman, and Joan D. Aikens.\n",
      "The six-member panel had one Republican vacancy, and one of its three Democrats was absent.\n",
      "\"There was a majority of the commission that felt they had gone too far,\" Mrs. Elliott said in an interview, speaking of the coalition.\n",
      "\"And we'll have to let the courts decide that now\".\n",
      "She said the case \"has some big issues in it\" and predicted that it would eventually reach the Supreme Court.\n",
      "The suit is significant, not only because it involves the most influential organization of religious conservatives -- it reports 1.7 million members -- but also because of its timing, coming on the eve of the Republican National Convention, which opens Aug.\n",
      "12 in San Diego.\n",
      "The coalition is expected to have a visible role at the gathering.\n",
      "The suit takes aim at the Christian Coalition's most effective organizing tool: the millions of voter guides, listing candidates' records on a variety of issues, that it distributes before elections.\n",
      "The coalition has long contended that the guides are carefully written to avoid any partisan tone.\n",
      "But with this action pending, churches may fear that they would risk their tax-exempt status by allowing the coalition to distribute the guides on church property.\n",
      "The dispute may also provide an important test in Federal election law over the significance of an organization's coordination with a party or a candidate.\n",
      "The suit asserts that the voter guides do not have to advocate expressly the election or defeat of a candidate to be a problem; instead, it contends that the legal questions arise because the coalition coordinated the content and distribution of its voter guides so as to favor one candidate over another.\n",
      "The ultimate resolution of that matter could affect the relationships between candidates and other issue-advocacy groups of all political stripes, like the A.F.L.-C.I.O., Sierra Club and the United States Chamber of Commerce.\n",
      "The suit complicates the questions involving the Christian Coalition, which had already been under scrutiny by the Internal Revenue Service over whether its 1989 bid for tax-exempt status should be granted.\n",
      "The I.R.S. could be influenced by the election commission.\n",
      "Both agencies have in the past eyed each other closely when dealing with overlapping cases.\n",
      "Other nonprofit organizations establish political action committees that take part in political activities.\n",
      "Those committees are required to make their spending public and to abide by Federal spending and contribution limits.\n",
      "But the Christian Coalition argues that its activities are educational and not political, and it therefore does not follow the restrictions required of P.A.C.'s.\n",
      "In its suit, the commission does not address the issue of whether the coalition's principal purpose is to engage in political activity, a matter that touches upon both tax law and election law.\n",
      "The suit asks the court to impose fines against the coalition that could amount to hundreds of thousands of dollars, to force the coalition to stop using its own money to promote candidates and to report related spending to help candidates.\n",
      "Mike Russell, the Christian Coalition's communications director, said today, \"This is a completely baseless and legally threadbare attempt by a feckless Federal agency to silence people of faith and deny them their First Amendment rights\".\n",

      "To support its charge that the coalition was backing candidates, not just educating its followers, the commission cited a mailed package entitled \"Reclaim America\" that the coalition distributed to voters in the 1994 campaign and said it had included a scorecard rating Congressional candidates.\n",
      "The suit says: \"The cover letter, signed by Pat Robertson, asserted that the enclosed scorecard would be an important tool for affecting the outcome of the upcoming elections.\n",
      "It stated: 'This scorecard will give America's Christian voters the facts they will need to distinguish between good and misguided Congressmen.\n",
      "' \"  The suit also contends that the Christian Coalition, in \"coordination, cooperation and/or consultation\" with Mr. Bush's re-election campaign in 1992, spent money on identifying voters and getting them to the polls, as well as for the preparation and distribution of 28 million voter guides.\n",
      "In 1990, the commission asserts, the coalition coordinated with the re-election campaign of Senator Helms, a North Carolina Republican, to distribute 750,000 voter guides in the state and make about 29,800 telephone calls in a get-out-the-vote effort.\n",
      "That same year, the suit said, the coalition coordinated with the National Republican Senatorial Committee to produce and distribute 5 million to 10 million voter guides to help Republican Senate candidates in seven states.\n",
      "The commission said that the Christian Coalition, based in Virginia Beach, Va.\n",
      ", had made similar efforts to help Mr. North -- producing and distributing about 1.7 million voter guides -- in his unsuccessful drive in 1994 to defeat Senator Charles S. Robb of Virginia.\n",
      "In addition, the suit says, the coalition made such efforts on behalf of Mr. Gingrich in his 1994 campaign in Georgia, for Representative J. D. Hayworth of Arizona in his 1994 campaign and for Representative Bob Inglis of South Carolina in 1994.\n",
      "The suit cited Mr. Reed for appearing at a two-day conference in January 1992 at which he \"expressly advocated the defeat\" of Representative Pat Williams, a Montana Democrat, and failing to report the cost of the meeting as an independent expenditure against Mr. Williams.\n",
      "The commission's suit stemmed from a four-year investigation that was prompted by two complaints accusing the Christian Coalition of violating Federal election laws.\n",

      "THE first continuing global electronic AIDS conference has started here in an effort to provide vital medical information to doctors in developing countries.\n",
      "The electronic conference, called Program for Collaboration Against AIDS and Related Epidemics (Procaare), was announced last week and is operating 24 hours a day.\n",
      "It uses the Internet and other computer-based communications technologies as a low-cost forum for exchanging information on the spread, treatment and prevention of AIDS.\n",
      "Procaare was created by Satellife Inc., a nonprofit organization based in Boston that provides electronic communications and information services to health workers in developing nations.\n",
      "The project, which will be run much like a professional medical conference, is a collaborative effort among leading AIDS researchers from the Harvard AIDS Institute and Harvard School of Public Health, the European AIDS Commission, the Uganda Viral Research Institute and the All-India Institute of Medical Sciences.\n",
      "\"The developing countries simply don't have the resources to combat an infectious ailment like AIDS,\" said Dr. Richard Marlink, a co-director of the project who is executive director of the Harvard AIDS Institute.\n",
      "\"Of the 6,500 new H.I.V. infections every day, 95 percent are occurring in the developing world\".\n",
      "Dr. Marlink said the conference would provide a crucial link for sharing AIDS-related information.\n",
      "For example, he said one of the first requests when Procaare started posting information in February was from a doctor in Pakistan's Ministry of Health who requested advice on H.I.V. home care services.\n",
      "\"A day later, he got a response from Puerto Rico with a report on their home-care project,\" Dr. Marlink said.\n",
      "\"And the next day, he received a similar response from Zambia.\n",
      "All this occurred without the industrialized countries\".\n",
      "For the developing countries, where regular mail service is extremely slow and a telephone call between Pakistan and Zambia costs $20 for a minute, the electronic conference provides unlimited access through electronic mail not only to Zambia but to more than 30 other countries.\n",
      "Dr. Ramnik Xavier of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston, a co-director of Procaare, said the system brought together doctors and clinicians in an unprecedented way to share current data and invaluable experience.\n",
      "Having studied medicine in Zimbabwe, Dr. Xavier said that by 1988, as the AIDS epidemic worsened, 40 percent of patients admitted to his hospital each day had AIDS-related symptoms.\n",
      "\"Most often in these countries,\" he said, \"these patients are managed by overworked junior doctors and there are very limited resources and access to information on the best therapeutic options.\n",
      "And rarely do the physicians in Zimbabwe know what physicians in Zambia were doing to treat AIDS patients\".\n",
      "He pointed to successful programs in Thailand and Tanzania that focused on promoting the use of condoms to halt the spread of AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases.\n",
      "\"Sharing information on how these programs were implemented would be a major benefit to developing countries,\" he said.\n",
      "The conference, which can be subscribed to at no charge by any interested researcher, clinician or health practitioner, will be carried over Healthnet, Satellife's computer-based network of health professionals in 30 countries.\n",
      "The system provides access eight times a day to the Internet for literature searches, access to medical libraries and for sending and receiving messages.\n",
      "Satellife has established these links at no cost to developing countries.\n",
      "Healthnet charges a small monthly fee to each subscriber site to help defray local costs.\n",
      "Dr. Marlink said the conference would be \"highly monitored\" so it would not simply be an open chat between health care providers.\n",

      "GENEVA -- Doctors Without Borders, one of Europe's biggest charities, said Friday that it was turning its back on millions of dollars from the European Union to protest the bloc's policies on refugees and migrants.\n",
      "''We will no longer take funds from the E.U. and its member states in protest at their shameful deterrence policies and their intensification of efforts to push people back from European shores,'' the charity said in a statement.\n",
      "It has sharply criticized the agreement between the European Union and Turkey that will provide more than $6 billion to Turkey in return for stopping the flow of refugees to Europe and taking back migrants who cross the Aegean Sea to Greece.\n",
      "That deal, the charity said, made aid to Turkey contingent on tighter border controls, not on the basis of humanitarian need.\n",
      "''What we are doing here is taking a decision not to take funds from states and institutions that actually jeopardize the very ability to provide one of the main forms of assistance,'' Jérôme Oberreit, the secretary general of Doctors Without Borders, said in a telephone interview.\n",
      "European Union policies are ''jeopardizing the very concept of the refugee,'' Mr. Oberreit said.\n",
      "''We're talking about individual human beings here, we can't accept the collateral damage of broader policies.''\n",
      "Doctors Without Borders, also known by its French initials M.S.F., received 56 million euros ($63 million) from European Union institutions, member states and Norway, in 2015; Mr. Oberreit said the decision would not affect the charity's ability to assist refugees and migrants.\n",
      "Those contributions -- including ?\n",
      "19 million from the European Commission's Humanitarian Aid Office -- make up less than 8 percent of the charity's global budget, which comes mostly from private sources.\n",
      "Mr. Oberreit said Doctors Without Borders' operations would continue, drawing on its reserves and an emergency budget.\n",
      "The European Union's chief spokesman, Margaritis Schinas, told reporters in Brussels that the bloc took note of the charity's decision but insisted that its aid was aimed at addressing the basic needs of migrants in Turkey, including protection, and was focused on the most vulnerable.\n",
      "The number crossing the Aegean Sea has fallen since the agreement with Turkey came into effect in March, and European countries' decisions to close borders along the main routes taken by migrants has left more than 50,000 people stranded in camps in Greece.\n",
      "Those who still manage to reach the Greek islands from Turkey are held in overcrowded camps in poor conditions, Mr. Oberreit said.\n",
      "''We will not be instrumentalized into a system that is doing more harm than good through detention,'' he said.\n",
      "He expressed fears that the deal with Turkey could set a dangerous precedent: Kenya had cited that agreement as a reason for closing Dadaab, one of the world's biggest and oldest refugee camps with 330,000 people, Mr. Oberreit said.\n",
      "The European Union is now working on agreements similar to its deal with Turkey with 16 other countries in Africa and the Middle East, from which many of the migrants trying to reach Europe have fled.\n",
      "''Deterrence policies sold to the public as humanitarian solutions have only exacerbated the suffering of people in desperate need,'' Mr. Oberreit said in a statement.\n",
      "''There is nothing remotely humanitarian in hiding this despair offshore.''\n",

      "BRUSSELS -- The European Union authorities, seeking to balance the scale of the migration crisis with the reluctance of some countries to take in refugees, offered a series of proposals on Wednesday that would give member states more latitude while offering them 10,000 euros for each refugee they accept.\n",
      "Europe has struggled to come up with a cohesive plan to deal with the more than one million migrants who have reached Europe in the past two years, and the proposals from the European Commission, the bloc's executive arm, reflect a renewed effort to impose clearer rules for both countries and migrants.\n",
      "The commission proposed a common procedure for resettling refugees from camps in countries outside the bloc, like Turkey, that would give member states the option of joining together to decide the overall number of people to take in and how to spread out the refugees among those nations.\n",
      "That represents a form of solidarity among the willing, though it is unlikely to include countries like Hungary and Slovakia that have resisted taking in more migrants, and it falls short of a mandatory system that would be applied across the European Union.\n",
      "A separate, mandatory program to relocate asylum seekers who have used clandestine routes to enter the bloc has fallen far short of expectations.\n",
      "Member states were unwilling to share the burden of the huge migrant influx, and just 3,000 migrants out of an intended 160,000 have been relocated.\n",
      "Under the terms of the new proposal, which formalizes some existing, temporary measures, the voluntary system would be supported by a cash incentive to resettle migrants from camps outside the European Union.\n",
      "The rules need approval from European Union governments and the European Parliament before becoming law.\n",
      "The figure of ?\n",
      "10,000, about $11,100, was previously available to member states that accepted refugees from outside the bloc under a temporary two-year system for 22,000 people set up last year.\n",
      "About 8,000 refugees have benefited from that program.\n",
      "The bloc has been overhauling its asylum and migration rules in the wake of a major crisis last year, when huge numbers of migrants arrived from Africa and the Middle East.\n",
      "Many traveled through Turkey and crossed the Aegean Sea to Greece before settling in Germany.\n",
      "The proposals were directed at both member states and migrants, with measures intended to deter those registered as asylum seekers in one state from leaving for another by specifying ''clear obligations,'' said Dimitris Avramopoulos, the European commissioner for migration.\n",
      "The European Union requires migrants to register for asylum in the first country they reach in the bloc.\n",
      "Many have been forced to register in Greece -- the most popular landing point -- even though they would rather go elsewhere.\n",
      "Migrants who break the rules could face rapid rejection of their applications, officials at the commission said.\n",
      "Jean Lambert, a British member of the European Parliament, criticized the proposed rules on asylum, saying the new duties represented ''further retrograde steps in a number of areas of asylum policy'' and ''an obsession with punitive measures.''\n",
      "The number of arrivals has dropped significantly since the European Union reached an agreement with Turkey to crack down on human smuggling across the Aegean, a short but perilous crossing.\n",

      "Gevisser writes:  Amy Biehl was an idealistic young American Fulbright scholar, blond and brilliant, who spent nearly a year in South Africa in 1993, during the turbulent interregnum between Nelson Mandela's release from jail and his election as president.\n",
      "She was murdered during a protest in the Cape township of Gugulethu, two days before her planned return to the United States, solely because of her white skin; four of her putative killers were found guilty of murder, and then granted amnesty in 1998 by the country's celebrated Truth and Reconciliation Commission (T.R.C.).\n",
      "This was on the basis that they were following the policies of the Pan-Africanist Congress of Azania, the liberation movement to which they belonged.\n",
      "Biehl's parents pardoned the men, embraced them, and even employed two in the foundation they established in their daughter's name, an act of grand reconciliation that came to symbolize what Archbishop Desmond Tutu, the T.R.C. chairman, termed ''the rainbow nation.''\n",
      "As it is, this story, although well rehearsed, would provide material enough for a book.\n",

      "After shooting the Palestinian once in the head, Sergeant Azaria said, he was berated by Major Naaman.\n",
      "The commander shouted, ''Are you crazy?''\n",
      "Sergeant Azaria testified, according to Israeli radio, and then slapped him.\n",
      "It was the first time Sergeant Azaria claimed that Major Naaman had hit him, and the prosecutor immediately questioned why Sergeant Azaria's previous written testimony did not include that detail.\n",
      "The prosecutor, Nadav Weisman, said he would press Sergeant Azaria on the issue during cross-examination, which was scheduled to begin by Monday.\n",
      "Sergeant Azaria, a medic, said that just before he shot the Palestinian, he had been under great stress as he furiously tried to stanch the flow of blood from a stab wound of one of the victims of an attack: another soldier who bunked near him.\n",
      "''I pressed down on the wound with my hands,'' Sergeant Azaria said, according to Ynet.\n",

      "MILAN -- Do people have their seasons read anymore?\n",
      "It's hard to pinpoint when the fad began for determining personality type or what to wear seasonally based on answers to quizzes correlating the color of one's eyes or wallet, whether one is ''authoritative and assertive'' or ''gentle and approachable,'' or if you prefer puppies to pussy cats.\n",
      "Yet the questionnaires are still out there, all over the web.\n",
      "And, having just completed one, I can report that if I were a season, I would be summer: ''Bright and cheerful and rarely in a bad mood!''\n",
      "Having always thought of myself as more of a fall (or possibly a fall transitioning to winter, given to moments as bright as a turning leaf, along with the crepuscular funks brought on by the waning light), I find this baffling.\n",
      "And it occurs to me that in failing to keep up with the new climate realities -- like the chill and biblical rains that have afflicted much of Europe this year -- those loopy New Age surveys have something in common with the designers showing their spring 2017 men's wear on runways here.\n",
      "Thus -- as handsome and restrained as were the oversized trenches and tidy suits that Rodolfo Paglialunga showed at Jil Sander; as closely as the modular elements hewed to a design idiom honed long ago by Ms. Sander (seeming more than ever like a modern master); as discreet as the palette of pale taupe, washy ombré blues and greens; as unostentatious as the effects achieved by a squared-off worker's jacket rendered with a notched lapel or a dark floral pattern abstracted so it resembles oil slick on the floor of a garage -- the collection left a viewer in some confusion.\n",
      "What is it exactly about a boxy knee-length coat in black leather that says vernal to Mr. Paglialunga?\n",
      "How about a duster coat the size of a pup tent?\n",
      "Could Mr. Paglialunga be a winter who has mistaken himself for a spring?\n",
      "Or do none of us know what season we're in anymore?\n",
      "The thought nagged at me throughout the first two days of shows here, when designers like Neil Barrett again offered a display of why he remains a durable presence in a fickle business with a typically disciplined collection of bomber jackets with diagonal inserts reminiscent of marquetry; mock turtlenecks; safari, field and bomber jackets in a palette inspired by American television shows popular throughout Britain in the '70s (YouTube almost any old Soul Train episode for a glimpse of those cognac, butterscotch, chocolate and gold hues), and slim, high-waist denim trousers.\n",
      "Yet there was something seasonally discordant.\n",
      "The aural backdrop for the Barrett show was a doomy cover of ''California Dreamin','' a tune that, for all it contributed to mythos of sunny Southern California, was written in New York during a particular bitter winter in 1963.\n",
      "Though hardly suggestive of picnics or beach trips, as least the leather coats and blazers in Consuelo Castiglioni's show for Marni didn't read like body armor.\n",
      "In fact, the leather was shaved to considerable lightness and leavened further by the sprightly game of peekaboo Ms. Castiglioni seemed to be playing with all the other clothes.\n",
      "Detaching waistbands from trousers and shorts, slicing a deep V into coats and jackets at the nape of the neck, she reattached and suspended the elements using Velcro tabs.\n",
      "Possibly it was this designer's accustomed offbeat way of using elements of dress all around us -- kiddie pull-ups, zip-apart travelers' chinos, hospital gowns -- to translate for men the success she's had in creating the kind of irresistible (though wacko) women's wear that blogs like Man Repeller were created to celebrate.\n",
      "Are men in large numbers prepared to geek out along with Ms. Castiglioni's girl posse?\n",
      "That remains to be seen; Marni is a distinctly specialized taste.\n",
      "Likely, though, when her clothes reach stores, some of the more outré styling elements will have fallen away and consumers will be left with things like finely proportioned shorts and trousers that are more consistent with current trends among the cool dudes of Tokyo and Seoul, South Korea, than much in Italian design.\n",
      "They will also have an opportunity to buy some of her sling-back sandals made from what look like inner tubes -- Marni's answer to Crocs.\n",
      "It's worth noting here that weird footgear has become a leitmotif in men's fashion.\n",
      "Everyone seems to produce it now except shoe companies.\n",
      "First out were the fur-lined, snaffle-bit slip-ons that became the first runaway hit for Alessandro Michele after he took over as Gucci's creative director.\n",
      "Then there were the platform-soled espadrilles Prada sold so briskly you could never find them in stock.\n",
      "Now, in a play made by Mauro Ravizza Krieger, creative director of the Italian tailoring house Pal Zileri, we have another appealing stunt shoe of a type that I have never seen before.\n",
      "It is amazing, given the sheer laziness of most men, that it took someone this long to come up with a pair of backless slip-on brogues.\n",
      "The shoes were a memorable foundation on which to build an otherwise uninspiring apparel collection.\n",
      "If they catch on, as it seems likely, there will be joy in the halls of Mayhoola for Investments, the Qatar-based investor group that bought a majority stake in Pal Zileri in 2014 (after paying $850 million for Valentino two years earlier).\n",

      "At first, the ascension of Stefan Larsson to chief executive of Ralph Lauren's fashion house might seem an odd fit.\n",
      "Mr. Larsson is widely credited with vastly expanding H&M's cheap chic fashion business and then rescuing Old Navy, transforming the retailer from a dowdy discount brand into a symbol of affordable fast fashion.\n",
      "And while the customer base for those two retail companies may have a lot in common, the upper end of the Lauren brand still sought to capture a far more aristocratic country club clientele.\n",
      "But over all, the Lauren brand has struggled to remain relevant in a rapidly changing retail world, and has recently suffered from a slumping share price and increased competition.\n",
      "And that's where Mr. Larsson is viewed as being able to step in and manage the company.\n",
      "Dressed in a well-pressed blue suit, Mr. Larsson joined Mr. Lauren at the label's sprawling Midtown Manhattan headquarters on Tuesday to discuss the appeal of making the transition.\n",
      "''Here is somebody who has done something that few people will ever do in their whole lifetime, speaking about the future, speaking about how the best things are ahead,'' Mr. Larsson said.\n",
      "''It was just very intriguing to me.''\n",
      "In 2012, when Mr. Larsson joined Old Navy, a subsidiary of Gap Inc., it was already troubled.\n",
      "Sales had fallen by more than $1 billion from 2006 to 2008.\n",
      "The recession had hurt retail spending, even at lower-end brands.\n",
      "And Old Navy could not keep up with nimbler competitors, like H&M, that had figured out how to respond more quickly to fickle fashion trends.\n",
      "Mr. Larsson has said that he frequently felt unfashionable growing up in a small town in Sweden, where trends took time to arrive from the big cities.\n",
      "As a retail executive, he helped change that model.\n",
      "Mr. Larsson spent 15 years at H&M before joining Old Navy and oversaw the company's global expansion into a fast-fashion empire.\n",
      "''Using what he learned at H&M, he did a better job of matching supply and demand,'' said Bridget Weishaar, a retail analyst with Morningstar.\n",
      "''He realized that people who were buying cheap clothes still wanted to look good.''\n",
      "Mr. Larsson, 41, eschewed what he called the ''clothes by the pound'' approach favored by many discount retailers.\n",
      "Instead, he focused more on design, and on cutting down how long it took to get clothes from the design stage onto the shelves.\n",
      "The strategy worked.\n",
      "Last year, Old Navy took in nearly $6 billion in sales in the United States, making up nearly 40 percent of Gap Inc.'s global revenue -- nearly as much as the Gap and Banana Republic brands combined.\n",
      "''Unfortunately, their sister division, the Gap, doesn't seem to have either read the memo or can't seem to get organized,'' said Mark A. Cohen, director of retail studies at Columbia University's business school and former chief executive of Sears Canada.\n",
      "''Allegedly, Gap is trying to do the same, but it remains to be seen whether they can do it or not.''\n",
      "Gap Inc. stock fell 3 percent in after-hours trading on Tuesday.\n",
      "''Given Mr. Larsson's strong leadership and contribution to the Old Navy division, we see this as a loss for Gap,'' John Morris, a retail analyst with BMO Capital Markets, wrote in a note shortly after the Lauren announcement.\n",
      "''The Old Navy team really coalesced behind his leadership, at a time when the division needed it, and morale significantly improved.''\n",
      "Jill Stanton, Old Navy's executive vice president for global product, will take over Mr. Larsson's duties as the company hunts for a permanent replacement.\n",
      "Art Peck, Gap's chief executive, repeatedly emphasized his confidence in Ms. Stanton's abilities and said he expected ''no change'' in operations as Old Navy heads into the all-important holiday season.\n",
      "''Stefan's leaving,'' Mr. Peck said.\n",
      "''People do what they do, and that happens.''\n",

      "I knew Colin Kaepernick was in trouble when, in response to criticism that he should develop more of a ''pocket presence,'' he reached out to Kurt Warner over the summer for help in becoming a better pocket passer.\n",
      "No disrespect to Warner, who played 12 N.F.L. seasons and led St. Louis to a Super Bowl title and Arizona to its first Super Bowl appearance.\n",
      "But Kaepernick's pocket presence is not what kept defensive coordinators awake at night trying to plan for his special gifts.\n",
      "That is not who Kaepernick is.\n",
      "Not who he will ever be.\n",
      "Not why he was catapulted to fame in his second season, when he came off the bench in relief of Alex Smith and led San Francisco to the Super Bowl.\n",
      "On Sunday, a national audience saw flashes of the old Kaepernick and -- for 49ers fans at least -- a hopeful glimpse of the new.\n",
      "He ran for a couple of first downs, threw two passes for touchdowns and was 22 of 33.\n",
      "Kaepernick did what quarterbacks, whether they play in the pocket or out, are supposed to do: He distributed.\n",
      "After the Giants took a 23-20 lead late in the fourth quarter, Kaepernick led the 49ers on an 80-yard scoring drive that gave the 49ers a chance, although the Giants pulled it out with just over a minute left to win by 30-27.\n",
      "Now, in his fourth year as a starter, his fifth in the league, Kaepernick has seen defenses adjust and the hounds descend.\n",
      "Just as they descended on Cleveland's Johnny Manziel, as they descended on Washington's Robert Griffin III and as they are about to descend on Indianapolis's Andrew Luck if he does not pull it together.\n",
      "Griffin, Manziel and Luck, however, have different issues from those facing Kaepernick.\n",
      "No one is pressuring them to change how they play the game.\n",
      "They suffer, instead, from a variation of too much too soon.\n",
      "This is increasingly a plague within the universe of youth sports, a culture that picks, and praises, athletes before their time, before they have even had a chance to truly excel under pressure.\n",
      "Identifying young talent is common in sports, which, almost by definition, are a young person's pursuit.\n",
      "But the process keeps intensifying, keeps digging deeper, as the sports industry becomes more lucrative and a pro sports career -- like a mirage -- seems so tantalizingly close that you can taste it.\n",
      "Manziel was given way too much too soon, in high school and certainly in college, where his boorish behavior was indulged as the university built a program on his arm.\n",
      "Manziel ultimately sought treatment for alcohol addiction when his behavior jeopardized his pro career.\n",
      "Griffin came into the N.F.L. riding a wave of hype and was handed the starting quarterback's job in Washington.\n",
      "He was taken into the owner's box -- figuratively and literally -- and was given the keys to the kingdom before he was ready.\n",
      "Now Griffin, who suffered a career-altering knee injury in 2013, is close to being exiled.\n",
      "Influential voices within the sports media establishment put Luck on the same plane as Denver's Peyton Manning, New England's Tom Brady and Green Bay's Aaron Rodgers before he completed his first N.F.L. season.\n",
      "Kaepernick's problem is not having received too much too soon, and then having trouble dealing with it.\n",
      "His challenge is shutting out the voices chirping in his ear, the voices pressuring him to change the style of play that catapulted him to stardom, pressuring him to change the dynamism that distinguishes him and Seattle's Russell Wilson from the rest of the field.\n",
      "After Sunday's game, Kaepernick played down the notion that he has felt pressure.\n",
      "''I have to go out and play football,'' he said.\n",
      "''It's a game at the end of the day; it's not life or death.\n",
      "I play to win, I do everything I can to try to help this team win.''\n",
      "Conversations about the effectiveness of Kaepernick's style are an extension of a decades-old debate -- in fact, I'd call it a feud -- between the old-school pocket-presence America and a movement to be permanently liberated from the pocket.\n",
      "Truth is, the American pocket is collapsing.\n",
      "I'm amused to hear retired N.F.L. players bemoan offensive linemen who never, or rarely, get into a three-point stance, or running backs who never learn to pass block, or spread-offense quarterbacks who cannot take the ball from under center.\n",
      "Bulletin: That is where the N.F.L. is headed, aided by rules that make the game offense friendly.\n",
      "Brady and the Mannings, Peyton and the Giants' Eli, are about all that is left of the pure pocket passers we once embraced.\n",
      "Then there are shades of gray and a desire to have it both ways.\n",
      "The Cowboys' Tony Romo, who has not sniffed Super Bowl excitement, is lionized for his improvisational skills.\n",
      "Rodgers is praised for his moves in the pocket.\n",
      "Yet Wilson, who led his team to two Super Bowls and was a handoff away from a second ring, has been explained away as a mere game manager who benefits from a great defense.\n",
      "Kaepernick is often dismissed as a one- or two-hit wonder.\n",
      "''He is one of the most gifted quarterbacks in the league,'' the quarterback guru George Whitfield said.\n",
      "Whitfield, who runs an academy for quarterbacks, has worked with young players like Cam Newton, Luck, Manziel and the Tennessee Titans rookie Marcus Mariota.\n",
      "In a league that makes adjustments to innovation from quarter to quarter, even series to series, Kaepernick has to evolve.\n",
      "''That may mean being confident in what you're doing personally and knowing the areas in which you're going to have to continue to amp up,'' Whitfield said.\n",
      "I'm intrigued by the early conversations fluttering around Mariota, who rose to stardom at Oregon because of his ability to run and pass.\n",
      "He is praised because, after four games, he has thrown just three interceptions and run only 10 times.\n",
      "He has been sacked 14 times, however, and it's not even winter.\n",
      "There are gifts, and there are learned skills.\n",
      "Kaepernick led the 49ers to the Super Bowl in 2012 during his first season as a starter; in 2013, he led San Francisco to the N.F.C. championship, but a potential game-winning pass was intercepted in the end zone by the Seahawks.\n",
      "Last season, Kaepernick signed a contract extension worth up to $126 million, with $13 million guaranteed.\n",

      "When 87 Republican freshmen arrived in the House of Representatives in 2011 after an election swayed by the Tea Party movement swept Republicans back into the majority, the question was simple: Would they change Washington, or would Washington change them?\n",
      "Four years later, the answer seems clear.\n",
      "Buoyed by a vastly increased majority -- Republicans now hold 247 House seats -- highly gerrymandered districts and the rise of an intricately coordinated web of conservative media, the new right has had a significant impact on public policy and the ways of Washington.\n",
      "Discretionary government spending, the original target of the group, has dropped to 6.5 percent of the economy in 2015, from 9.1 percent in 2010, according to the Congressional Budget Office.\n",
      "Social issues, which had seemed to be receding in legislative fights, have returned full force.\n",
      "It is also much harder to get things done.\n",
      "The group set off a government shutdown in 2013, came within hours of shuttering the Department of Homeland Security last winter, recently pushed Speaker John A. Boehner of Ohio to announce his resignation and blocked his preferred replacement.\n",
      "But the agenda of the most conservative wing of the House, as personified by the roughly 40 members of the Freedom Caucus, has evolved substantially since 2011.\n",
      "Once unified almost solely around the goal of reducing government spending, the group has expanded its targets to an array of Obama administration policies, most notably immigration this year.\n",
      "At first libertarian -- the group early on torpedoed a routine vote on the Patriot Act -- it has become more interventionist.\n",
      "While Planned Parenthood has long been in the cross hairs of conservatives, its funding has become a central point of conflict.\n",
      "But it is increasingly clear that what the Freedom Caucus wants more than specific legislation is power.\n",
      "Its members want a greater voice in how legislation comes together and how the House functions, areas traditionally directed by a leadership team of seasoned lawmakers.\n",
      "They have endorsed a candidate for speaker, Representative Daniel Webster of Florida, who, while not as conservative as many of them, seems attractive largely because of his willingness to do as they say.\n",
      "Their long list of demands of a new speaker has few legislative goals, and focuses instead on getting more authority by changing the rules of the House.\n",
      "The fury with which they have challenged their own leaders has largely been embraced by their constituents.\n",
      "Those views poured forth in interviews during last week's congressional recess in five districts represented by members of the Freedom Caucus.\n",
      "''The activists, the hard-core folks who come to everything, that represent that small percentage of the base -- they are just very excited,'' said Representative Mick Mulvaney of South Carolina, an original leader of the new right.\n",
      "''They feel like for the first time something has changed in Washington, D.C.''  The hard-liners come from all over the country, but they are concentrated in more exurban and rural areas in the South and Rocky Mountain West.\n",
      "But their unity so far has been unstinting in wanting change.\n",
      "A Continuing Campaign: Dave Brat  ASHLAND, Va.\n",
      "-- The potency of the hard-line Republican revolt revealed itself here a little more than a year ago when Dave Brat, an obscure economics professor in this sleepy college town, toppled Eric Cantor, the second-ranking member of the House, in a primary.\n",
      "But to talk to Mr. Brat's supporters, the campaign has never stopped.\n",
      "''A.B.C.'' -- Anyone but Cantor -- Mr. Brat's backers said last year.\n",
      "Now, they say, that was only a start: Republicans need to purge any career politician who capitulates to the Democrats if the party wants to address issues like the federal debt, the treatment of veterans and abortion.\n",
      "''I think something is needed to shake up the Republican Party,'' said Lynda Sprouse, who owns an insulation company.\n",
      "''It's typical of all politicians that they get to Washington and they join the old boys' club.''\n",
      "Mr. Brat, 51, who taught at Randolph-Macon College here for almost two decades, campaigned far to Mr. Cantor's right.\n",
      "He leveraged the debate in Congress over immigration to argue that Mr. Cantor had become captive to the Washington political establishment and had forgotten about his constituents in Virginia's Seventh Congressional District.\n",
      "The message found ready purchase among voters in the district, which runs from Richmond and its suburbs to the rural reaches of Washington, an expanse that is largely white, deeply Republican and mostly exurban.\n",
      "The area, a cradle of the American Revolution and then of the Civil War, has evolved into a Republican stronghold embedded in a swing state.\n",
      "The uprising that ousted Mr. Cantor was born of anger from voters like Randy Wingfield, 54, who owns a painting contracting business.\n",
      "He said he had written to Mr. Cantor several times asking for help and had not received a reply.\n",
      "Mr. Brat, he said, could not be more different from the man he replaced.\n",
      "''He's standing up for what we want here,'' Mr. Wingfield said as he walked up to an ''OktoBRATfest'' fund-raiser for the congressman.\n",
      "And if it required a government debt default or shutdown, it was all right by him.\n",
      "Mr. Brat has made his views vivid, putting out a list of 10 commitments he expects any potential speaker to make, including opposing amnesty for illegal immigrants and overhauling House rules to reduce the power of the speaker.\n",
      "Mr. Brat declined several requests to be interviewed, saying he was too busy.\n",
      "Between constituent events last week, he did attend a rally for Donald J. Trump in Richmond, where he got a shout-out from the stage.\n",
      "''There's a guy -- he shows you can do things,'' Mr. Trump said.\n",
      "''That's never happened before, what he did!\n",
      "I just give him, just a lot of credit.''\n",

      "-- A lot of people in this small town, an hour's drive from Atlanta, get their news from talk radio.\n",
      "''We all listen to WSB,'' said Marion Pearson, the owner of a photo studio, who was at a ''Coffee and Conversation'' recently with Representative Jody Hice at the local Chamber of Commerce.\n",
      "''In the morning we have Herman Cain out of Atlanta,'' Ms. Pearson said.\n",
      "''Then we have Rush from noon to 3, and then Hannity from 3 to 5, and then -- oh, what's that guy's name?\n",
      "-- the RedState guy, Erick Erickson, from 5 to 7.''\n",
      "Georgia's 10th District got Mr. Hice, 55, from talk radio, too.\n",
      "Before seeking office in 2014, Mr. Hice, a Southern Baptist minister, had his own show, syndicated on 400 stations, on which listeners heard him weigh in against Islam and homosexuality and for gun rights and traditional Christian values.\n",
      "Constituents say they do not agree with Mr. Hice on everything but trust him to represent them.\n",
      "''He represents my values,'' said Bruce Henry, a Jasper County commissioner.\n",
      "''We're a rural community.\n",
      "He's a Bible-believing man.\n",
      "He believes in the Second Amendment.\n",
      "He's honest.''\n",
      "As for the willingness of Mr. Hice and the Freedom Caucus to shut down the government, Mr. Henry said: ''I just think we need to be firmer, put our foot down and not do so much deal-making.\n",
      "Sometimes, you have to take it to that point, especially if it was over the funding of Planned Parenthood.''\n",
      "Like Georgia itself, the 10th District was long a Democratic stronghold.\n",
      "''When we moved here 40 years ago, the Democratic primary was the election,'' said Kathy Mudd, the editor of The Monticello News.\n",
      "Since 1994, it has been the reverse.\n",
      "While the demographics of much of Georgia are rapidly changing, the district remains more than 70 percent white, and the politics have moved further right.\n",
      "Last year, Mr. Hice was the most conservative of seven Republican primary candidates.\n",
      "At the Chamber of Commerce, Mr. Hice stood amid a small herd of stuffed deer and told an approving audience that he was still fighting to block the Iran nuclear deal, cut funding for Planned Parenthood and keep federal spending caps in place.\n",
      "In an interview later, he also said he would not vote to raise the debt ceiling, no matter the economic consequences.\n",
      "''Where does the insanity stop?''\n",
      "he asked.\n",
      "''We have got to cut spending and live within our means.''\n",
      "Mr. Hice's positions add up to a larger view of the country he would like to see, which he painted for constituents in Flovilla, Ga.\n",
      ", where he met with wounded veterans.\n",
      "''Our constitutional principles, freedom and liberty, respect, tolerance for one another,'' Mr. Hice said, ''but where we have a government of the people, for the people, where government is limited in its intrusiveness in our lives, and freedom is able to flourish and businesses are able to do what they do without being suffocated through regulations and taxation -- the America that you and I grew up in.''\n",

      "''Confer wisdom on our lawmakers that they remember their duties to everyday citizens like us as they push for the changes necessary to protect our freedoms,'' she said.\n",
      "Her words resonated with Dan Farley, a real estate broker and organic farmer, who heartily agreed.\n",
      "''The decisions on the federal level just don't represent the will of the people,'' he said.\n",
      "And with Jay Lawrence, a longtime radio talk show host serving his first term as state representative, who said that he kept his focus on his district and that there was ''no point worrying about what happens in Washington.''\n",
      "They were part of a welcoming crowd for Representative David Schweikert, a member of the Freedom Caucus who has been waging war with his own Republican leadership in the House.\n",
      "Running on his 12th cup of cappuccino, Mr. Schweikert bounded to the front of the room.\n",
      "First elected to Congress in the Tea Party wave of 2010, Mr. Schweikert represents a district, the Sixth, that spills from the northern edge of Scottsdale into a clump of conservative suburbs.\n",
      "They include Paradise Valley, which was home to Barry Goldwater, and Fountain Hills, home to Sheriff Joe Arpaio.\n",
      "The questions from his constituents were tinged with hostility, but the animus was not directed at him.\n",
      "''Instead of calling them liberals, progressives, why not call them socialists?''\n",
      "one man asked.\n",
      "How could he ''prevent more damage,'' another man put it, ''until Obama leaves office?''\n",
      "''Here in Arizona, there are four of us looking to change the process,'' said Mr. Schweikert, 53, referring to three other representatives from Arizona who have joined the Freedom Caucus.\n",
      "''When other Republicans come shooting at us,'' he continued, ''we need you to back us up.''\n",
      "He was unsparing in his criticism of House Republican leaders, who, Mr. Schweikert said, suffered from ''an incredible void of creativity'' and exercised their power ''only for power's sake.''\n",
      "The contest for House speaker ''is not about an individual, but about the policies and procedures we live under,'' he said.\n",
      "''We have to push and push and push to make sure the House is an institution that does its job well.''\n",
      "Legislation, he said, should stall or advance based on merit.\n",
      "The crowd cheered.\n",
      "Then Mr. Schweikert jauntily said his goodbyes and walked outside.\n",
      "''That genuflecting thing gets a little old,'' he said, quick-stepping across the parking lot to his pickup truck.\n",
      "''We need a disrupter.''\n",
      "-- Fernanda Santos  Thanks for Fighting Leaders: Justin Amash  GRAND RAPIDS, Mich.\n",
      "-- Tucked away in a local government building, the town-hall-style meeting offered constituents of Representative Justin Amash a chance to share what was on their minds: gratitude.\n",
      "''First I want to say thank you for the great job you're doing, and thank you for helping ease Boehner out of there,'' said a man sitting in the first row.\n",
      "Mr. Amash, a Republican easily re-elected last year, soaked in the praise, a welcome departure from the accusations of obstructionism that dog him and others in the Freedom Caucus in Washington.\n",
      "''I don't know if he'd describe it as 'easing him out of there,''' he said.\n",
      "''But thanks.''\n",
      "Mr. Amash represents Michigan's Third District, which is anchored in the state's most prosperous metropolitan area, yet many of his constituents fret that Congress is stalled as the Obama administration rolls along unchecked.\n",
      "Constituents placed little blame on Mr. Amash, 35, who has spent most of his nearly five years in Congress fighting his own party's leadership.\n",
      "He criticized Mr. Boehner for using ''intimidation and coercion'' to compel members to vote his way.\n",
      "''The problem isn't that he wasn't conservative enough,'' Mr. Amash said.\n",
      "''It's that he doesn't follow the process.''\n",
      "Not everyone was buying Mr. Amash's answer.\n",
      "To Robin Daning, 65, a Grand Rapids resident who voted for Mr. Amash in 2010, the grievances sounded slight.\n",
      "''What did he really do that's wrong that hasn't been done ever since I've been alive?''\n",
      "Mr. Daning said of Mr. Boehner.\n",
      "''The sausage is ugly, and that's the way it works.''\n",
      "Describing himself as a former Republican, Mr. Daning acknowledged that he might be in the minority in his frustrations with the Freedom Caucus.\n",
      "''On my block of 17 houses, I cannot find one person that agrees with what they're doing,'' he said.\n",
      "''But I come to these meetings, and then I'll find them.\n",
      "That's one of the reasons that I come, because I want to look around and say, 'Who are these people?''\n",
      "'  Nearly 85 percent white and encompassing part of southwest Michigan, Mr. Amash's district has long leaned Republican.\n",
      "The airport is one of many local institutions that bear the name of its most famous former resident, President Gerald R. Ford.\n",
      "While defying tidy characterizations -- Grand Rapids is strongly Democratic, but its suburbs and exurbs are heavily Republican -- constituents at the meeting were unified in the belief that Congress could not get things done.\n",
      "And Dave Zondervan, 71, said he hoped the Freedom Caucus would continue to grow.\n",
      "''We'd all sail along smoothly if we didn't have any obstructionists, but then again, where have we gone the last 50 years?''\n",

      "''He's a Republican,'' Mr. Cate said, unfurling a smile as long as the nearby Chesapeake Bay Bridge.\n",
      "And that was really enough.\n",
      "Mr. Cate did not delve into Mr. Harris's legislative agenda -- revising regulations for temporary work visas, undoing environmental regulations, increasing military spending and keeping residents of the District of Columbia from obtaining marijuana.\n",
      "Mr. Cate, a 49-year-old builder, is satisfied simply to be represented by a Republican in a heavily Democratic state.\n",
      "And in many respects, Mr. Harris has Democrats, who drew his heavily gerrymandered district, to thank for the office that he holds.\n",
      "That is the story of many of the members of the Freedom Caucus who have muscled their way into outsize power in Congress: Their districts have been drawn in such a way as to almost ensure a hard-line conservative winner.\n",
      "Democrats put the state's most Republican areas in Mr. Harris's district, which includes the entire Eastern Shore, dominated by seafood, tourism and agriculture, and the working-class and suburban areas that hug the Pennsylvania border.\n",
      "The district, the First, stretches from the elegant boating town of St. Michaels to the hardened suburbs of Baltimore.\n",
      "This made some Democrats safer but gave Mr. Harris a district in which Republicans hold a 14-percentage-point advantage over Democrats among registered voters.\n",
      "But, like many Republicans in heavily Republican districts, Mr. Harris, 58, feels the pressure to move to the right with each primary.\n",
      "''I was pretty conservative before I came to Congress,'' said Mr. Harris, a former state senator and an anesthesiologist.\n",
      "''The current challenger I have is someone being more conservative who criticizes my vote for John Boehner as speaker.''\n",
      "He added: ''I feel strongly that we should go to nonpartisan redistricting.\n",
      "Gerrymandering clearly creates hyperpartisan districts.''\n",
      "Mr. Harris insists that he does not want a more conservative nation, simply a greater voice in how bills are put together in Congress.\n",
      "''I think people have misinterpreted what our goal is,'' he said.\n",
      "''We proved it when we endorsed for speaker the most liberal of the three candidates.\n",
      "I personally believe since the House is right of center overall, the result will be right-of-center legislation, but occasionally there will be Democrats who get to offer their ideas, too.''\n",

      "A growing number of Iranian human rights activists and artists, including a Nobel laureate and people who have spent time in prison for their views, are asking Americans in a social media campaign to support the nuclear deal with Iran.\n",
      "Their messages, uploaded to YouTube and Facebook over the past few days, are a new element in the emotional arguments for and against the nuclear agreement that are underway in the United States ahead of a mid-September vote in Congress.\n",
      "''For Iranians, it's quite clear that almost all major human rights activists and pro-democracy activists are supporting this deal,'' said Mohammadreza Jalaeipour, a former political prisoner and organizer of the opposition Green movement, the target of a crackdown after the disputed 2009 elections in Iran.\n",
      "Mr. Jalaeipour, who helped coordinate the production of the videos, said in a telephone interview on Tuesday that he had posted a call for 30-second videos in support of the nuclear agreement and made one of himself.\n",
      "Forty human rights advocates and artists have appeared in their own video messages or are preparing them, Mr. Jalaeipour said.\n",
      "They speak in English or in Persian with English subtitles.\n",
      "The campaign is partly a response to a video message uploaded this month and broadcast on American television by Citizens for a Nuclear Free Iran, a pro-Israel organization in the United States.\n",
      "In that message, Ahmad Batebi, a dissident journalist and rights advocate who fled Iran for the United States seven years ago, says Iran cannot be trusted to abide by the agreement and urges Congress to oppose it.\n",
      "''Opponents of the deal are using the key words 'democracy' and 'human rights' a lot,'' Mr. Jalaeipour said, ''and we wanted to raise our voices and show the American audience that we are pro-democracy activists.''\n",
      "Their messages of support have not been reported in Iran's state-run news media, Mr. Jalaeipour and others said, but there has been no effort to stifle them.\n",
      "Some of Iran's best-known human rights defenders have participated, including Nasrin Sotoudeh, a lawyer who spent years in prison for her activism; Shirin Ebadi, a lawyer who won the 2003 Nobel Peace Prize; and Ghoncheh Ghavami, who challenged the Iranian government's rule preventing women from attending men's volleyball games.\n",

      "Supporters of the accord include a range of arms control experts, diplomats and nuclear scientists.\n",
      "Mr. Jalaeipour said the motivation to create supportive messages had intensified after Citizens for a Nuclear Free Iran -- created by the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, one of the most influential lobbying organizations in Washington -- began a national ad campaign featuring Mr. Batebi, who fled to the United States in 2008.\n",
      "In that ad, Mr. Batebi describes being tortured in prison even though Iran had signed a treaty banning torture.\n",

      "In the hourlong conversation with Richard A. Harpootlian, the former chairman of the South Carolina Democratic Party, the vice president did not reveal which way he was leaning, according to a Democrat familiar with the conversation who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss a private call.\n",
      "Mr. Biden described the recent death of his son Beau as an ''open wound'' that had not begun to heal, and was grappling with whether he could devote his full energy to a campaign.\n",
      "But at the same time, Mr. Biden and those who support him are moving to put the pieces into place for a possible candidacy.\n",
      "The vice president directed Mr. Harpootlian to get in touch with one of his closest political advisers, Mike Donilon, and has been calling other supporters.\n",
      "And he has permitted his advisers to discreetly contact operatives in early nominating states to determine how fast they could organize a campaign.\n",
      "A once bare-bones ''Draft Biden'' movement has entered a new, more aggressive phrase that resembles an exploratory committee.\n",
      "With a Biden family loyalist now involved, the group is contacting Democratic insiders about everything from how to establish a presence at the Iowa State Fair this week to which Democratic donors and officials in South Carolina need to be contacted.\n",
      "As Hillary Rodham Clinton endures a summer marked by the lowest favorable ratings of her career, questions about her email practices as secretary of state and a threat from her left from Senator Bernie Sanders, some Democrats are looking for an alternative.\n",
      "Mrs. Clinton still has considerable strengths, but if she appeared politically invincible, it is unlikely that Mr. Biden and his supporters would be making the phone calls to supporters, which were first reported in The Wall Street Journal.\n",
      "''The vice president brings a different voice in,'' said Tony Bisignano, an Iowa state senator and Biden supporter since the vice president's first bid began in 1987.\n",
      "''If you're a liberal, you've got to like Bernie's message.\n",
      "But I don't think enough people that like his message have full confidence he can be elected.\n",
      "And Hillary obviously has a very strong organization here.\n",
      "But people are very apprehensive about her because they always feel like there's a shoe to drop.''\n",
      "Still, there is no waiting movement for Mr. Biden to tap into: He has not a cent of campaign money and has not taken any formal steps toward a campaign.\n",
      "The ramped-up effort from the Draft Biden group and calls from some of Mr. Biden's advisers have raised eyebrows among Democrats.\n",
      "Mr. Donilon, who has worked for Mr. Biden for decades, spoke this week to Jeff Link, a longtime Iowa Democratic strategist.\n",
      "''He asked me what I was hearing on the ground,'' recalled Mr. Link.\n",
      "Mr. Link said he told him: ''Sanders has real energy and people are for Hillary but don't seem superenthused.''\n",
      "Both Mr. Donilon and Mr. Biden have, in their conversations, been careful to avoid revealing the vice president's leanings, according to those have spoken with them.\n",
      "Other uncommitted Democratic operatives in early nominating states have received calls from Greg Schultz, another aide to Mr. Biden.\n",
      "Much of the work is being done by the Draft Biden ''super PAC,'' a once quixotic operation founded by William Pierce, a 27-year-old Army Reserve captain drawn to Mr. Biden's record on helping veterans.\n",
      "The group recently brought on Josh Alcorn, a senior adviser and finance director to Beau Biden who had been central to helping the younger Biden begin his own 2016 campaign for governor of Delaware.\n",
      "Now, Mr. Alcorn is reaching out to Mr. Biden's network of supporters in Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and elsewhere, to begin to drum up support, donations and build the group's list.\n",
      "''We're in the phase of: What can we do over the next six weeks as the vice president makes his decision?\n",
      "How do we prepare the way for him?''\n",
      "Mr. Alcorn said in an interview.\n",
      "For starters, Draft Biden is planning a social media campaign soon to remind voters about Mr. Biden's accomplishments in the Senate and the White House, in addition to his off-the-cuff political style.\n",
      "''There's something happening in the American electorate, people are gravitating to candidates who call it like they see it,'' Mr. Alcorn said.\n",
      "When asked whether Mr. Biden and his innermost circle of advisers had blessed Draft Biden's efforts, Mr. Alcorn demurred.\n",
      "''I wouldn't be here if I didn't think it was the right thing to do,'' he said.\n",
      "Mrs. Clinton and her supporters have handled Mr. Biden gingerly, but they are skeptical he would enter the race to a surge of excitement.\n",
      "''There's a genuine fondness for the vice president, but I don't think there's a yearning for him to get in the race,'' said former Gov.\n",
      "Jim Hodges of South Carolina.\n",
      "Still, Mrs. Clinton's closest aides have privately expressed concerns that the campaign would have to spend heavily to defeat Mr. Biden in a primary.\n",
      "''We should all just let the vice president be with his family and make whatever decision he believes is right for him,'' Mrs. Clinton recently said.\n",

      "Will they boo or will they cheer when Boomer Esiason returns to Cincinnati tonight?\n",
      "\"It'll probably be mixed,\" he suggested yesterday.\n",
      "\"I was a part of the total operation, on and off the field, for nine years\".\n",
      "In fact, he still has interests there.\n",
      "Not many players eat dinner in a restaurant they own in the enemy's city.\n",
      "But he planned last night to take some of his teammates to his place just across the Ohio River in Kentucky.\n",
      "Another restaurant has named a dish for him: Steak Esiason.\n",
      "And his son, Gunnar, has a wing named for him in Children's Hospital, where he goes periodically for treatment for cystic fibrosis.\n",
      "Esiason performed for nine seasons with the Bengals, 1984-1992, reaching the Super Bowl once and Pro Bowl three times.\n",
      "He keeps a home in Cincinnati.\n",
      "Of course, there is always the speculation that he could return there.\n",
      "He is in the final year of his Jets contract.\n",
      "The Bengals' quarterback, Jeff Blake, is in the final year of his.\n",
      "His backup, David Klingler -- the man who replaced Esiason -- is in the last year of his deal.\n",
      "Even Coach David Shula, who has another year on his contact, is not secure given his history of 11 victories in 3 seasons.\n",
      "But Esiason's old coach, Bruce Coslet, is the Bengals' offensive coordinator and rumors have repeatedly surfaced that he would replace Shula if there is another bad campaign.\n",
      "Coslet loves Esiason, and vice versa.\n",
      "Although Esiason was brought up on Long Island and his heroes were the New York teams, he became a part of the Cincinnati fabric when the Bengals drafted him in 1984.\n",
      "\"They had no personality there,\" he explained.\n",
      "\"Kenny Anderson had been the quarterback there a long time.\n",
      "He's a nice guy, but not a personality\".\n",
      "Esiason said he got involved in causes, in events, in the news media, in business, in living there.\n",
      "\"He brought a charisma to the town that hadn't been since since probably the heyday of Pete Rose,\" his former teammate Cris Collinsworth, now a Cincinnati talk-show host, said.\n",
      "\"I got involved just like I do here,\" Esiason said.\n",
      "\"The difference is that there it's 600,000 people and here it's 15 million\".\n",
      "Before the arrival of Klingler, Esiason's low point was the 1987 strike.\n",
      "He had been the most outspoken Bengal.\n",
      "\"I was the player rep,\" he recalled.\n",
      "\"I was totally excommunicated from the entire city\".\n",
      "But gradually, his union activities were forgotten and he was forgiven.\n",
      "There are many ironies in his return: Klingler was sidelined for half a season with a broken jaw; Blake became the starter after being dropped by the Jets a year after Esiason arrived; Anderson is the quarterbacks' coach.\n",
      "And, of course, there is Coslet -- dismissed by the Jets after the 1993 season, after Esiason's first year.\n",
      "Does Esiason ever reflect on what might have happened if he had stayed in Cincinnati?\n",
      "\"I would have gotten killed,\" he said.\n",
      "The Bengals' offensive line unraveled with the departure of Max Montoya and Anthony Munoz.\n",
      "Esiason recalled that in his last game in Cincinnati in 1992, after Klingler had replaced him as the starter, he suddenly had to go in when Klingler was injured.\n",
      "\"That was Munoz's last game,\" said Boomer.\n",
      "\"It was like I was retiring, too.\n",
      "They had posters all over the stadium for both of us.\n",
      "I got a standing ovation.\n",
      "It was nice\".\n",
      "He hadn't been there since.\n",
      "He won't stay long tonight, perhaps the first half.\n",

      "More than 2,000 people were evacuated from an apartment complex in Yonkers yesterday after an improbable series of events on Thursday night -- an underground fire that caused an electrical short that ruptured a water main -- left the building without heat, power or water, officials said.\n",
      "The problem began about 8:30 P.M. Thursday, when a fire started in an electrical vault beneath the Riverview Apartments on Riverdale Avenue, causing smoke to billow from manhole covers and fill stairways.\n",
      "Fire Department officials said the blaze destroyed several large electrical panels and caused the electrical system for all the buildings and for a public school within the complex to short out.\n",
      "Because the electrical system was grounded to the 20-inch water main, fire officials said, the short caused seals on the pipe joints to melt, and the pipe burst, flooding some of the buildings' basements.\n",
      "Michael Spall, a spokesman for Con Edison, which supplies electricity and gas to the buildings, said the company turned off power and was also ordered yesterday afternoon to turn off the gas because of the danger of explosions, leaving the buildings with no utilities whatsoever.\n",
      "Some residents in the complex's 450 apartments were taken out of the building Thursday night, and the evacuation continued through yesterday afternoon, with several elderly residents being carried out.\n",

      "Time Warner Inc.'s $8 billion purchase of Turner Broadcasting System Inc. seems likely to be approved by the companies' boards this week, ending a tortuous, monthlong courtship that portends a media marriage marked more by tumult than tranquillity.\n",
      "One major roadblock in the negotiations was apparently overcome in the last several days.\n",
      "According to individuals close to the talks, Time Warner agreed to modify a provision of its bylaws so that John C. Malone, the cable television entrepreneur whose Liberty Media Corporation owns a large stake in Turner, would have the right to acquire an even more valuable stake in the new corporation.\n",
      "Over the weekend, some bankers who had helped structure the financial underpinnings of the deal sat on the sidelines as lawyers for all the parties sifted through a mountain of documents, making sure the terms of the deal were clearly defined.\n",
      "If he succeeds in pulling off the merger, Gerald M. Levin, Time Warner's chairman, is betting that he can save money and still make Time Warner grow faster with Ted Turner's Turner Broadcasting than it would be able to on its own.\n",
      "He is adopting a strategy that focuses on content and programming, a change from his past tactics of buying cable systems.\n",
      "And Mr. Levin is showing a striking confidence that he can master the challenges of joining forces with two of the most complex and, by some measures, unpredictable personalities in the world of information technology, Mr. Malone and Mr. Turner.\n",
      "If the merger goes through -- and given Mr. Malone's negotiating toughness, regulatory hurdles and the potential for shareholder lawsuits, not everyone concerned would say that it will -- some of the best-known brands in the media business, from Warner Brothers to Cable News Network to Time magazine, would be part of an entertainment colossus with $22 billion in annual sales and $40 billion in assets.\n",
      "Though some of the companies' operations would seem to be a natural fit, with their brand names reinforcing one another, fusing them is bound to be difficult.\n",
      "Recent media mergers underscore the notion that size brings with it the daunting challenge of meshing diverse cultures in complex corporate environments that are abnormally charged with investor demands to show solid financial results.\n",
      "\"Conceptually it is an attractive deal,\" said Mario Gabelli, a major mutual-fund manager who invests in Turner and Time Warner.\n",
      "\"When the dust settles, Time Warner will have an attractive collection of assets that now need to be managed\".\n",
      "Oddly enough, Time Warner itself is the product of a merger that analysts see as having failed to deliver on its promises or to lift the company's stock price to hoped-for levels.\n",
      "Mr. Levin has not been able to reduce the company's debt enough for Wall Street's satisfaction, nor has he overcome the troublesome legacy he inherited: a corporate structure rife with internal fiefs.\n",
      "The rivalries that have emerged over the last three years are now so evident that at times during the merger talks with Turner the company has looked as if it was negotiating with itself.\n",
      "Time Warner's performance in managing its 1989 merger has not been as troubled as the record of its Japanese rivals and their acquisitions.\n",
      "The Sony Corporation purchased CBS Records and Columbia Pictures, only to write off $3.2 billion of its investment last year as a lack of management continuity led to the uneven financial performance of Columbia's films.\n",
      "And a lack of apparent ways to blend two companies' resources, complicated by managerial friction, persuaded the Matsushita Electric Industrial Company to sell its 80 percent stake in MCA Inc. at a loss this year.\n",
      "The News Corporation and Viacom Inc., the two media conglomerates whose methods of expansion have brought them a measure of success, have one thing in common that Time Warner lacks: Each has a single controlling shareholder.\n",
      "The News Corporation's Rupert Murdoch and Viacom's Sumner M. Redstone have the ability to weather tough times without worrying about losing their jobs.\n",
      "Both are self-made entrepreneurs steeped in the entertainment business.\n",
      "And during the last decade, Mr. Murdoch has been widely viewed as having successfully managed a string of worldwide purchases.\n",
      "Viacom's purchase of Paramount Communications is just a year old, but the company seems to be performing well.\n",
      "Mr. Redstone sold cable systems and other assets to slash debt, and he has been persistent in integrating Paramount's management into Viacom, even though dismissals were required.\n",
      "Time Warner's Mr. Levin, who is not a major shareholder in his company, is in a different situation.\n",
      "\"He is under great pressure to start delivering the results of the new alliance,\" noted Howard Anderson, a managing director at the Yankee Group, a consulting firm based in Boston.\n",
      "\"A controlling shareholder such as Mr. Redstone can set his own timetable\".\n",
      "One result of the past weeks' negotiations has been that Mr. Malone has been given a larger potential say in the new enterprise, because of the adoption of rules that would allow his company, or any other, to raise its stake beyond the ceiling currently set for individual stockholders.\n",
      "If the deal goes through, Liberty's stake of more than 50 million shares of Turner Broadcasting will give Mr. Malone an 8 percent stake in the new enterprise, second only to Mr. Turner's 10 percent holding.\n",
      "Individuals close to the negotiations said that Time Warner was now proposing to allow any shareholder to own 20 percent of its stock before its takeover defenses would come into play, rather than the current 15 percent limit.\n",
      "This, coupled with an agreement between Liberty Media and Turner Broadcasting that each would have a right of first refusal on any purchase of the other's stake in Time Warner, clears the way for Liberty Media to buy more Time Warner stock.\n",
      "The current takeover defense was prompted by the Seagram Company's accumulation of Time Warner stock.\n",
      "Seagram's investment was seen as a potentially hostile move, but its 14.9 percent stake, as well as those of other current holders, stands to be diluted by the purchase agreement, which would add more than 180 million new shares to Time Warner's existing base of 470 million shares.\n",
      "The size of the new company might be enough to preclude other hostile investors, some analysts say.\n",
      "But, in contrast to Seagram, which at the time of its purchase of Time Warner shares had few media interests, the core business of Liberty and its parent company, Tele-Communications Inc., is the federally regulated cable-TV business, which is also a key part of Time Warner's business.\n",
      "Under Federal Communications Commission regulations, two cable companies are forbidden to hold more than 5 percent interest in the other if their combined systems reach more than 30 percent of homes in the United States.\n",
      "Between Time Warner and Tele-Communications, that threshold would be passed.\n",
      "Mr. Malone apparently wanted voting stock in the combined Turner and Time Warner, so the parties are said to have agreed to put Liberty Media's stake into a voting trust, whose trustees would control the votes, according to people close to the talks.\n",
      "It was not clear whether Time Warner management would act as a trustee or whether outsiders would fill that role.\n",
      "That voting trust would disappear, and Mr. Malone's impact would grow, if the F.C.C. rule were found unconstitutional in a challenge pending in the United States Court of Appeals in Washington.\n",
      "Additionally, Liberty Media would get a premium for some of its shares, as well as certain valuable assurances from Turner that it would have long-term deals to carry Turner's cable services on the cable systems of Tele-Communications at favorable rates.\n",
      "What Liberty Media would not receive are dividends on the preferred stock it holds.\n",
      "\"The dividends would have looked too much like debt,\" an investment banker said.\n",
      "Mr. Levin is offering to acquire most Turner shares for three-quarters of one Time Warner share apiece to avoid taking on more debt.\n",
      "It is that debt from the original 1989 merger of Time and Warner Brothers that some media executives say has hobbled the company and kept it from meeting its promise of melding the production capabilities of Warner with Time's cable operations.\n",
      "If Mr. Levin completes the deal, he will have put his company on more solid financial footing.\n",
      "He will not have reduced the company's $16 billion debt, but there will be more cash available to pay the interest on that debt.\n",
      "He will also have shown prowess in completing a hugely complex deal and presumably will have gained at least some short-term support from his newest and largest shareholders.\n",

      "Hours before Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice arrived here for talks on resolving the Middle East conflict, Israel increased the pressure Wednesday on Hamas, the militant Islamic group in control of the Gaza Strip, by declaring Gaza ''hostile territory.''\n",
      "The move opened the way for further restrictions on the supply of crucial goods like electricity and gasoline to Gaza.\n",
      "Israeli officials said the purpose of the declaration, by Israel's security cabinet, was to hold Hamas accountable for any further rocketing or other attacks on Israel from Gaza, which Hamas took over when it routed Fatah forces in June.\n",
      "Asked about the Israeli decision, Ms. Rice said, ''Hamas is a hostile entity to us as well.''\n",
      "Both Israel and the United States, as well as the European Union, classify Hamas as a terrorist organization, and Hamas has refused international demands that it recognize Israel's right to exist, forswear violence and accept all previous Israeli-Palestinian agreements.\n",
      "''We won't allow Hamas to hide behind other groups like Islamic Jihad,'' one Israeli official said, referring to the fact that many rockets are being launched by another militant group.\n",
      "''Hamas is doing everything now except firing the rockets, and we intend to hold them responsible.''\n",
      "The cabinet statement said ''additional sanctions will be placed on the Hamas regime in order to restrict the passage of various goods to the Gaza Strip and reduce the supply of fuel and electricity,'' as well as to tighten restrictions on the movement of people in and out of Gaza.\n",
      "Israel is not taking action yet, the officials emphasized, but one said that ''a clock is ticking'' on carrying out the measures.\n",
      "The Israeli defense minister, Ehud Barak, told the cabinet, ''The objective is to weaken Hamas,'' and he said that ''every day that passes brings us closer to an operation in Gaza.''\n",
      "A senior Israeli official said, ''We will supply all humanitarian necessities,'' including food, water and medical supplies.\n",
      "''But that doesn't mean they can drive their cars all around Gaza,'' the official said.\n",
      "''That's not a humanitarian need.''\n",
      "The official said Israel now supplied 60 percent of Gaza's electricity.\n",
      "''No one will cut off the electricity, but in response to direct attacks, we could hold Hamas responsible, and there may be some interruptions in electrical supplies.''\n",
      "Hamas reacted sharply.\n",
      "Sami Abu Zuhri, a Hamas spokesman in Gaza, called the Israeli decision ''a declaration of war against the Palestinian people, an attempt to target resistance forces and to undermine Hamas politically.''\n",
      "He said that Israel as an occupier must supply humanitarian needs, and that such a decision ''shows that Israel is not ready for political compromise with the Palestinians'' in peace talks.\n",
      "On Tuesday, the Hamas leader in Gaza, Ismail Haniya, met with Islamic Jihad to ask it to stop firing rockets for now, during the current holy month of Ramadan, and Hamas leaders in exile in Damascus will meet with Islamic Jihad leaders there to discuss a renewed cease-fire with Israel.\n",
      "In New York, the United Nations secretary general, Ban Ki-moon, warned that any cutoff of electricity or water to Gaza would violate international law and punish Palestinian civilians.\n",
      "''Such a step would be contrary to Israel's obligations toward the civilian population under international humanitarian and human rights law,'' Mr. Ban said in a statement.\n",
      "''I call for Israel to reconsider this decision.''\n",
      "A senior United States official, speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to comment on the matter publicly, said American officials had urged the Israelis to consider the humanitarian consequences in Gaza.\n",
      "He said Ms. Rice was not informed of the decision before she arrived.\n",
      "Under international law, Israel is considered an occupying power in Gaza, even though it has removed its troops and settlers from the territory.\n",
      "Denying civilians access to the necessities of life is considered collective punishment and a violation of international law under both the Hague and Geneva Conventions, although the amounts of resources like electricity considered essential could be subject to dispute.\n",
      "Electricity, water and gasoline are considered by many, like the Israeli rights lobbying organizations B'Tselem and Gisha, as well as Oxfam and other aid and rights groups, to be necessities.\n",
      "But the United States contended when it bombed power plants in Belgrade during the Kosovo war that electricity furthered Serbia's war effort.\n",
      "Israel made a similar case when it bombed Gaza's main power station in July 2006, after the capture of one of its soldiers.\n",
      "''Regardless of how they might cloak it, cutting off electricity to a civilian population is collective punishment and a violation of international law,'' said Sarit Michaeli of B'Tselem.\n",
      "''It doesn't really make a difference whether it's cutting off the supply from Israel or bombing the power station.''\n",
      "Israel says it will not cut off water, but most of Gaza's water is indigenous, pumped from wells with electricity.\n",
      "Electricity is also important for sewage treatment, Ms. Michaeli said.\n",
      "She condemned the Qassam rockets fired from Gaza and said that Israel was legally obligated to defend Israelis, but not by violating international law.\n",
      "Ms. Rice is here to press both the Israeli prime minister, Ehud Olmert, and the Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas of Fatah, to come up with a joint set of peace principles before an international meeting for which she will be the host, expected to be in Washington in mid-November.\n",
      "Hamas opposes Mr. Abbas's talks with Mr. Olmert, but expects them to go nowhere.\n",
      "Ms. Rice also said that the United States would not ''abandon the innocent Palestinians'' in Gaza.\n",
      "Privately, Bush administration officials said that they had been assured that Israel would not deny essential humanitarian supplies to Gazan civilians.\n",
      "Ms. Rice intends the November conference to tackle what she called the ''critical issues'' of Palestinian statehood.\n",
      "But plans for the conference remain vague, and both Mr. Olmert and Mr. Abbas are worried about raising expectations.\n",
      "Saudi Arabia has said it will not attend unless the conference addresses the final status issues that have bedeviled peace negotiators since 1979: the status of Jerusalem, the fate of Palestinian refugees who left, or were forced to leave, their homes, and the borders of a Palestinian state.\n",
      "Mr. Abbas's aides have said that he will ask Ms. Rice on Thursday not to set a firm date for the meeting until it is clear that he and Mr. Olmert can agree on a detailed joint statement.\n",
      "Israeli officials say the two men are talking substantively and interpreted Palestinian worries now as a form of lobbying of Ms. Rice.\n",
      "''I've been very clear that this meeting has to, in a substantive way, support the activities and the efforts of the parties to lay a foundation for the negotiation of a Palestinian state as soon as possible,'' Ms. Rice told reporters en route to Jerusalem.\n",
      "''I think everybody expects it to address critical issues and, you know, we don't expect anything less.''\n",
      "But it was clear during her news conference with Tzipi Livni, Israel's foreign minister, that Israel had not yet signed on to a discussion of final status issues.\n",
      "''I believe in realistic expectation,'' Ms. Livni said when asked if Israel was prepared to discuss final status.\n",
      "''Of course we would like to end the conflict right away.''\n",
      "But, she added, ''we need to find what are the common denominators.''\n",
      "Ms. Rice met with other senior Israeli politicians later on Wednesday and had a private dinner with Mr. Olmert that night, before meeting with Mr. Abbas and Palestinian officials in Ramallah on Thursday.\n",

      "A politically powerful industrialist is gunned down in an ambush linked to a  reputed  mobster.\n",
      "Investigators link the mobster to the national police commissioner.\n",
      "Prosecutors obtain a warrant for the commissioner's arrest.\n",
      "Then suddenly, the warrant vanishes -- and the chief prosecutor who secured it is removed from his job.\n",
      "Not even South Africa's political insiders know for sure where this mystery leads, and the man who does know, President Thabo Mbeki, is not saying anything.\n",
      "But political and legal experts alike increasingly suspect the worst: that a brutal two-year battle for power in the  governing African National Congress is spreading from party corridors into the government itself.\n",
      "With a convention to choose the party's next leader barely two months away, a bitter rivalry between the two major camps -- that of Mr. Mbeki, who aspires to continue as the party president, and that of the populist politician Jacob Zuma, who wants to replace him -- has become even more caustic.\n",
      "Mr. Mbeki fired Mr. Zuma as deputy president in 2005 after investigators tied Mr. Zuma to a bribery scandal involving a multibillion-dollar military contract.\n",
      "Mr. Zuma has regularly accused prosecutors, and by implication Mr. Mbeki, of manipulating the justice system for political ends.\n",
      "Many analysts dismissed that as sour grapes.\n",
      "Now the same issue has surfaced in the case of the national police commissioner, Jackie Selebi, a senior figure in the party who is broadly asserted to be an Mbeki supporter.\n",
      "And some analysts are no longer so certain.\n",
      "Marinus Wiechers, for one, says that that he fears that the temptation to use the government's powers for political ends has become irresistible.\n",
      "''The party-state is a thing that threatens all democracies, especially young democracies,'' Mr. Wiechers, a constitutional law expert and former university vice chancellor, said recently.\n",
      "''If you break down the separation of powers, you're certainly heading for a constitutional crisis.''\n",
      "Were that true, it would -- like Nixon's  use of the Internal Revenue Service against his critics -- be widely considered an affront to the nation's democratic values.\n",
      "In what has become known as the Selebi affair, however, neither Mr. Mbeki nor his aides have explained why they intervened in a legal proceeding to prevent Mr. Selebi's arrest.\n",
      "Rather, Mr. Mbeki has named a prominent member of the African National Congress to investigate the matter and broadly suggested that the full findings may not be made public for reasons of national security.\n",
      "Political commentators have already noted, acidly, that Nixon  used that excuse to cover up his own transgressions.\n",
      "The basics of the Selebi affair are about the only things that remain clear.\n",
      "In September 2005, hit men pumped seven shots into a Johannesburg mining magnate, Brent Kebble.\n",
      "Investigators implicated a reputed  organized-crime figure, Glenn Agliotti, known as the Landlord, who later said the Kebble murder was an ''assisted suicide'' that he helped arrange.\n",
      "Mr. Agliotti's cellphone records showed that he called Mr. Selebi -- South Africa's police commissioner and the president of Interpol, the international police organization -- from near the scene of the murder shortly after it occurred.\n",
      "In the ensuing outcry, Mr. Selebi denied any wrongdoing, called Mr. Agliotti a close friend and said he never discussed police business or criminal activity with him.\n",
      "Mr. Agliotti said he was only being a good citizen and reporting a crime to the police when he called Mr. Selebi.\n",
      "Mr. Mbeki declined to suspend or investigate Mr. Selebi, telling critics to have faith in his judgment.\n",
      "But investigators for South Africa's elite anti-corruption squad, the Scorpions, found evidence of crimes involving the two men.\n",
      "Last month, Vusi Pikoli, the head of the Scorpions and the nation's chief prosecutor, presented the secret evidence to two Johannesburg judges and secured warrants to arrest Mr. Selebi and to search his home and office.\n",
      "The warrants, however, were never executed.\n",
      "In late September, Mr. Mbeki's justice minister apparently learned of the warrants, demanded that Mr. Pikoli resign and then suspended him when he refused, according to local news reports.\n",
      "Mr. Pikoli's replacement then visited the two judges, asking them to rescind the warrants.\n",
      "The arrest warrant was canceled, the search warrant remains intact, Mr. Selebi remains in command -- and to date, nobody has explained why.\n",
      "Mr. Mbeki has asked Mr. Pikoli's successor to review the evidence against Mr. Selebi and to recommend whether any action is needed.\n",
      "Mr. Pikoli, meanwhile, is under investigation by Mr. Mbeki's appointee, apparently for prosecutorial excesses.\n",
      "While the public version of the charges is not specific, it suggests that Mr. Pikoli is accused of giving immunity too liberally to organized-crime figures in return for incriminating evidence against Mr. Selebi, and of securing his arrest warrant without informing higher-ups.\n",
      "In South Africa's Parliament, the African National Congress, which controls 7 in 10 seats, has closed ranks, and calls by the opposition to investigate the affair have been rebuffed.\n",
      "News of the arrest warrant and its reversal, aired in newspapers and only grudgingly confirmed by the government in the past month, has set off outrage in the news media and among South Africa's minuscule political opposition.\n",
      "After nearly two weeks of daily headlines, Mr. Mbeki's only public comment on the issue has been to joke that the president does not issue arrest warrants.\n",
      "''It's a big mess,'' said one veteran criminologist, who spoke on condition of anonymity because he feared losing work with the government, ''and it's a mess that comes from the uncertainty about the boundaries that separate the state from the ruling party.''\n",
      "Bereft of facts, South Africa has been rife with speculation.\n",
      "The most damning version accuses Mr. Mbeki of protecting Mr. Selebi, a member of his party's executive committee with some influence in the debate over the party's next leader.\n",
      "Another version draws on the longstanding rivalry between the Scorpions and South Africa's national police, the nation's leading law enforcement organizations, and suggests that Mr. Pikoli overreached in an attempt to dispatch a rival.\n",
      "The Scorpions also broke the bribery case that led to Mr. Zuma's dismissal in 2005.\n",
      "Although his friend and financial adviser has been sent to prison in that case, Mr. Zuma so far has evaded prosecution -- and some suggest that Mr. Mbeki has sidelined Mr. Pikoli because he has moved too slowly to eliminate Mr. Zuma as a political rival.\n",
      "Or it could mean nothing, with due process occurring behind the scenes.\n",
      "Mr. Mbeki is a famously distant politician, renowned not just for ignoring public opinion but for shunning it.\n",

      "Voters in this state have no excuse for complaining that all politicians are alike.\n",
      "Ideological differences as vast as Montana's mountains and prairies make the race for its only seat in the House of Representatives a classic political contest.\n",
      "The two opponents -- each a popular incumbent, one a liberal Democrat, one a conservative Republican -- disagree about almost everything.\n",
      "Representatives Ron Marlenee, the Republican, and Pat Williams, the Democrat, were forced into a face-off when the House was reapportioned after the 1990 census.\n",
      "Montana's population grew only 2 percent in the 1980's, much more slowly than the nation, so the state lost the second House seat it had had since 1913.\n",
      "Because the number of House seats has been fixed at 435 since the 1910 census, states with stagnant or falling populations lose representatives while growing states gain them.\n",
      "A Vast, Expensive Campaign  Now Montana has the most populous Congressional district ever created, with 799,065 people, and the largest in area after Alaska's.\n",
      "The area's vastness has kept the two candidates campaigning nonstop by car, plane, helicopter and horseback.\n",
      "Unlike many other contests between incumbents, this race pits two veterans who have strong out-of-state allies.\n",
      "So Mr. Marlenee (pronounced MAR-li-nay) and Mr. Williams are both confident they can raise the $1 million each has said he plans to spend.\n",
      "With two months to go, public and private polls show the race just about even, with each candidate running strongly in his former district: Mr. Marlenee in the agricultural east he has represented for 16 years; Mr. Williams in the mountainous west he has represented since 1979, from the union town of Butte to academic Missoula.\n",
      "Strongly Conservative Views  Mr. Marlenee's message is part classic Western conservatism that asks government only to go away and part traditional constituency concern; as the second ranking Republican on the House Agriculture Committee, he has won higher farm subsidies.\n",
      "He told small businessmen in Great Falls last week that \"well-intentioned\" measures like the Americans with Disabilities Act, workers' compensation laws, various civil rights statutes and the pending family-leave bill forced employers to mechanize because machines neither complained nor filed lawsuits.\n",
      "The bluff 57-year-old rancher says such laws \"give people a headache\" and are putting others out of work.\n",
      "Asked by reporters if his analysis was supported by economists or research, he replied, \"No economists\".\n",
      "He said, however, that the idea had been around for a while.\n",
      "Later, at a combative meeting with elderly voters, one man pressed him about the family-leave bill, which would require employers to give as many as 12 weeks' unpaid leave for family medical emergencies.\n",
      "Mr. Williams is a chief sponsor.\n",
      "If his son could get an unpaid leave from work to care for him, the man asked, \"that's a family value, isn't it\"?\n",
      "Mr. Marlenee said the bill, which the House is expected to send to President Bush for a likely veto in a week or two, was unnecessary.\n",
      "Instead of a new law, he suggested, \"if you're working for a jerk who won't give you medical leave to take care of your family, quit your job and find another\".\n",
      "'Noon and Midnight'  Mr. Williams, a carefully spoken 54-year-old labor advocate in the House, disagreed and predicted that the family-leave issue would help him.\n",
      "Finding another job is not much of an option in a state where the economy has been sluggish for several years -- where a new Wal-Mart recently had 1,700 applicants for 175 jobs that pay $6 an hour.\n",
      "Young people have been leaving the state in large numbers to look for work.\n",
      "Mr. Williams says this disagreement reflects the \"difference between noon and midnight\" that measures the political chasm between two candidates who share little more than an opposition to handgun control.\n",
      "Ratings by interest groups capture that gap.\n",
      "Since 1981 the American Conservative Union's average rating of key House votes gave Mr. Marlenee 90 percent and Mr. Williams 9 percent.\n",
      "The liberal Americans for Democratic Action gave Mr. Williams 87 percent and Mr. Marlenee 7 percent.\n",
      "In Washington, Mr. Marlenee is influential only on agriculture while Mr. Williams cuts a broader swath.\n",
      "In 1990 he led the House fight to preserve the budget of the National Endowment for the Arts.\n",
      "The eventual law banned grants for obscene materials or performances, but blocked Congressional efforts to specify what kinds of art were too vulgar for the Federal Government to finanace.\n",
      "That stand brought efforts by the Rev.\n",

      ", to defeat the lawmaker he calls \"Porno Pat\".\n",
      "Contrasting Campaign Styles  The rhetoric of the campaign also mirrors the candidates' differences.\n",
      "Mr. Marlenee attacks his foe as part of a \"politically corrupt\" House leadership.\n",
      "Mr. Williams can match him with attacks on Republican \"trickle-down economics\" but is uncomfortable with hitting back personally and directly.\n",
      "Mr. Williams, a former school teacher, prefers more elevated themes.\n",
      "He calls this election a referendum on the future of Montana, which, he said last weekend at a fund-raising lunch in Missoula, was the last state \"in the lower 48 to have an opportunity to set our destiny in major and meaningful ways\".\n",
      "He explained later in an interview: \"Montana is the brow of America's last hill.\n",
      "Montana is what America started out to be.\n",
      "Now we face the challenge of figuring out of how to manage the economy with the environment in a way that secures jobs\".\n",
      "The state also needs to manage the growth that is coming suddenly to places like Missoula and the Flathead Valley, he said.\n",
      "He is trying in the last days of the Congressional session to pass a bill that would open some of Montana's wilderness to logging while preserving other sections.\n",
      "Mr. Marlenee effectively blocked the last version of that bill in 1988 as too tough on development and logging.\n",
      "Spats Smother Issues  While Mr. Williams does not always please environmentalists, Mr. Marlenee almost never does.\n",
      "Since 1981 Mr. Marlenee has averaged a 13 percent rating from the League of Conservation voters, Mr. Williams 63 percent.\n",
      "These differences come through in debates and personal appearances, but many Montana voters may miss them.\n",
      "The local news media concentrate on reporting small spats, like Mr. Marlenee's complaint of political \"vandalism\" when a bumper sticker on a supporter's car was ripped off and replaced by one saying \"No Mo Ron\".\n",
      "But Montana voters may be spared squabbling over the House bank.\n",
      "Neither incumbent avoided problems.\n",
      "Mr. Williams had 66 overdrafts but Mr. Marlenee had 20.\n",
      "Whoever wins will have a big job just representing this vast state.\n",
      "In addition to a record number of constituents, there is an immense area to cover.\n",

      "The remarkable success of three-month-old Carmine's in the theater district underscores several trends among New York City diners.\n",
      "For one, New Yorkers, in spite of all the talk about a new abstemiousness, love to tackle quantities of food that would make a Jewish mother cry uncle.\n",
      "Second, these culinary sophisticates still have a vestigial soft spot for the outmoded Italian-American red-sauce restaurant.\n",
      "And it is also evident that the public craving for bargains is stronger than ever, whether it is a $19.92 lunch special or a place where you can split a $9 mountain of calamari four ways.\n",
      "Carmine's in Times Square is a cleverly conceived and assiduously refined concept that meets all those cravings.\n",
      "(The original Carmine's is on Broadway and 90th Street.\n",
      ") The owners certainly had a successful history to draw upon: they own the highly successful trio of Oriental restaurants called Ollie's Noodle Shop and Grille and the two Dock's Oyster Bar and Seafood Grills.\n",
      "Carmine's sprawling dining room is designed to look as if it has been around since vaudeville days, and to some extent it succeeds.\n",
      "Sand-colored sponged walls are covered with stock publicity photos, fans whirl overhead and tables are close but not too close.\n",
      "Those without reservations are dispatched to the bar near the entrance, where drinks are served in goblets that could double as vases.\n",
      "This prepares you for what is to come.\n",
      "\"Are you aware of our portions\"?\n",
      "a waiter inquires with a sheepish grin.\n",
      "If you are not, he encourages you to share plates and not over-order.\n",
      "He then sets down a capacious bread basket that also holds tasty little pieces of focaccia swabbed with garlic, cheese and tomato.\n",
      "After that, an engaging way to start is with a thin-crusted pizzette, or small pizza, for which toppings change daily.\n",
      "It might be a combination of fennel sausage, ripe tomato, heaps of garlic and mozzarella; roasted garlic and various cheeses, or wild mushrooms.\n",
      "Another good starter to share is the salad of fresh mozzarella, tomatoes, onion and greens in a well-blended vinaigrette.\n",
      "The house antipasto features good cheesy baked clams that are not overcooked, and crusty mozzarella en carrozza that is cleanly fried.\n",
      "One of the most popular starters is the awesome mound of crunchy calamari deep-fried in a peppery batter and served with a pulpy tomato sauce on the side.\n",
      "Carmine's large wine list, a mix of Italian and Californian, offers plenty for every taste and at excellent prices.\n",
      "Most offerings are $20 or less.\n",
      "The good-humored and well-trained servers at Carmine's seem endlessly amused watching diners try to finish the daunting rations.\n",
      "And considering the relentless crowds, they manage to keep a fairly close eye on each table.\n",
      "Of the pastas sampled, only about half can be recommended.\n",
      "Linguine with white clam sauce is lifeless, needing more garlic and seasonings.\n",
      "The red version is only marginally better.\n",
      "The best pasta sampled is the rigatoni with fennel sausage and broccoli in red sauce; another was a special, rigatoni with tomato, pine nuts, garlic, tomato and slices of moist chicken.\n",
      "Penne is appealing in a melange of white beans, sweet tomato sauce and broccoli.\n",
      "Gnocchi can be recommended, too, for its light and slightly resilient texture.\n",
      "Meat and fish dishes come in stunning sizes.\n",
      "The 36-ounce porterhouse, big enough for four and a doggie bag, was prepared precisely to order and served under a lusty sauce of tomatoes, sweet peppers and onions.\n",
      "The 20-ounce swordfish steak with tomato, basil, capers and black olives was well cooked one evening, a bit dry another day.\n",
      "Chicken scarpariello, with onions and fennel sausage, suffered from dryness, too.\n",
      "Gift certificates should be issued with dessert.\n",
      "The cannoli is a monster, but with a thick skin and not worth the calories, nor is the wet and grainy cheesecake.\n",
      "Bread pudding with raisins, on the other hand, is worth the indulgence.\n",
      "Carmine's could hardly be called a sophisticated Italian restaurant.\n",

      "'Private Domain'City Center131 West 55th Street  \"Private Domain,\" a masterwork of sinister beauty that Paul Taylor choreographed in 1969, has been revived this season with astonishing success.\n",
      "Like many of Mr. Taylor's other pieces, \"Private Domain\" operates on a complex conceptual level with its structural riddles coded over by more direct emotional images.\n",
      "The happy virtue of the Paul Taylor Dance Company's performance on Saturday afternoon was its ability to bring both planes of creativity to the fore.\n",
      "There is a disturbing resonance to \"Private Domain\" that becomes a voyeuristic glimpse into clinical eroticism.\n",
      "Sex without love appears to be its theme, and yet the dancers in various duets, solos and trios are moving in a neutral manner behind or inside three portals formed by a series of stark gray panels.\n",
      "The dancers are, in fact, often partly concealed behind the panels.\n",
      "On the formal level, \"Private Domain\" is an exercise in perception.\n",
      "One of its most tantalizing aspects is that spectators in different parts of the theater cannot see the same dance because of their angles in relation to those panels.\n",
      "Mary Cochran, for instance, jumps behind the central panel.\n",
      "One sees her takeoff and her landing, but not her flight, and one can wonder what happened to her in between, given the frequent abductions that Mr. Taylor offers in his best stylized manner throughout the piece.\n",
      "Elie Chaib, in what was originally Mr. Taylor's role, is sometimes seen with his body bisected by one of the panels.\n",
      "Mr. Chaib, who is having a splendid season with his forthright and commanding presence, has a major solo.\n",
      "It is full of sculptural shapes that carve into space with his shoulder leading the way or with his majestic arms flying out into the air.\n",
      "The solo is full of torment and ecstatic release, almost autoerotic in the same way that the loveless tumbling among the group is full of sexual suggestion.\n",
      "Context is everything here.\n",
      "\"Private Domain\" is a perfect collaborative work.\n",
      "Mr. Taylor took an existing score by Iannis Xenakis, \"Atrees,\" and matched its fragmentary nature with his own shards of choreography.\n",
      "Jennifer Tipton's lighting, menacing in both darkness and sudden brightness, operates hand in glove with Alex Katz's simple but powerful panels.\n",
      "His 1940's two-piece bathing suits for the women and trunks for the men are nothing less than startling in this atmosphere.\n",
      "Amid all the bare flesh, Mr. Taylor invests the action with lurking glances, reclining postures that look anything but restful, and dramatic moments in which individual dancers are swallowed up by the group.\n",
      "There is always room for a structural treat, as when Joao Mauricio echoes Mr. Chaib's dance but faces the rear rather than the front as he performs it.\n",
      "Karla Wolfangle, Sandra Stone, David Grenke (very special here), Francie Huber and Rachel Berman Benz completed the outstanding cast.\n",
      "The 1985 \"Roses\" was the opposite coin on the program to \"Private Domain\".\n",
      "It is as lyrical an ode to love as the other work is a harsh look at lack of feeling.\n",
      "Miss Huber and Mr. Grenke were the couple in white who distilled the love theme (to Heinrich Baermann's Adagio for Clarinet and Strings) that is set out earlier by five couples (to Wagner's \"Siegfried Idyll\").\n",
      "The mechanics of getting in and out of the difficult partnering was sometimes too obvious.\n",

      "Justin Kaplan, the biographer of Walt Whitman and Mark Twain, has performed a service for students of language and literature by bringing Bartlett's up to date for almost the rest of the 20th century.\n",
      "As general editor, he has shaken up good old Bartlett's (the first edition came out in 1855) and let its \"self-evident propositions, ceremonial boilerplate, gassy platitudes and fortune-cookie sentiments\" fall out.\n",
      "While retaining material essential to our culture -- Shakespeare leads with 1,960 quotations and the Bible follows with 1,591 -- he has added hundreds of items from the movies, books, theater, television (which turned out to be a slim source of originality), public affairs and politics.\n",

      "Former President Ronald Reagan -- who was caught delivering a fake Lincoln quotation at this year's Republican convention -- helped to make famous such movie lines as \"Win one for the Gipper\" (spoken by Mr. Reagan as George Gipp in the 1940 film \"Knute Rockne -- All American,\" written by Robert Buckner), \"Go ahead, make my day\" (spoken by Clint Eastwood, written by Joseph C. Stinson for the 1983 film, \"Sudden Impact\") and \"evil empire\" (written by George Lucas for his 1977 screenplay of \"Star Wars,\" not to describe the Soviet Union).\n",

      "Unless you need to go to the original source for context, it's helpful to look up something in Bartlett's because writings and sayings are often misquoted, misattributed and mistranslated.\n",
      "Consider the phrase \"You could look it up\".\n",
      "Don't bet your last sou or subway token that Casey Stengel said it first; he only popularized it.\n",

      "Refusing to Play  The 25-year-old Burke came to the Devils after the Winter Olympics in 1988 and led them to their first playoff berth.\n",
      "But he lost his starting job to Chris Terreri near the end of the 1990-91 season, began expressing unhappiness at that point, then refused to play all of last season.\n",
      "Instead, he starred on Canada's Olympic hockey team, which won the silver medal in February.\n",
      "While few National Hockey League teams had shown much interest in dealing for Burke, Weinrich was sought after around the league because of his tremendous offensive skills.\n",
      "Lou Lamoriello, the president and general manager of the Devils, defended his decision to part with Weinrich by saying that the Devils wanted to make room for Scott Niedermayer, an 18-year-old phenom whose offensive attributes as a defenseman are considered by many to be in the class of Paul Coffey or Brian Leetch.\n",
      "In addition, the emergence of Myles O'Connor and the decision to re-sign defenseman Tommy Albelin apparently encouraged Lamoriello to part with the 25-year-old Weinrich, who had 32 points in 76 games last season.\n",
      "Weinrich was attending a seminar in Pennsylvania yesterday and could not be reached.\n",
      "Lamoriello said he had spoken with Weinrich after the trade and that the player was not totally surprised.\n",
      "Defensemen Were Aware  \"All our defensemen knew that someone had to go with someone coming in,\" Lamoriello said, referring to the team's decision to keep Niedermayer for next season, rather than sending him back to his junior team as the Devils did last season after making him their top draft pick.\n",
      "The two draft choices the Devils got are Hartford's second pick in the 1993 draft and a conditional pick in the 1994 draft.\n",
      "The Whalers have been finishing low in the standings in recent years and the Devils may thus end up with good selections.\n",
      "Lamoriello had been under severe pressure to make a deal for Burke before the waiver draft the first week in October.\n",
      "The Devils planned to leave Burke unprotected in the waiver draft, which means they would get virtually nothing in return for his loss.\n",
      "Lamoriello was on the verge of making a deal for Burke last spring after he spurned the Devils and played for Canada in the Winter Olympics.\n",
      "But Burke thwarted those efforts by signing with the minor league San Diego Gulls just before the trade deadline on March 15, a contract from which Burke said he had obtained a release.\n",
      "\"We didn't want to make a deal unless it was going to help us,\" Lamoriello said.\n",
      "\"We felt this trade will help us not only immediately, but in the future.\n",
      "We're delighted with Bobby.\n",
      "He can play center ice if we need him and he has tremendous skill\".\n",
      "Holik said he was excited about the trade because he would be playing in what he called the best division in hockey.\n",
      "The Patrick Division produced the Stanley Cup winner the last two years and is considered the strongest in the league.\n",
      "\"It will be a big challenge,\" Holik said.\n",
      "\"I didn't show everything in me in Hartford.\n",
      "I had a new coach every year.\n",
      "I was on a checking line a lot and never played the power play\".\n",
      "Holik, who is 6 feet 3 inches and weighs 220 pounds, had 21 goals and 24 assists in 76 games last season after 21 goals and 22 assists in 78 games in his rookie season two years ago, when the Whalers made him their first choice in the draft.\n",
      "The Whalers had 18 goals in their seven playoff games last season.\n",
      "All Holik had to show for in the seven games he played was a single assist.\n",
      "\"I don't want to use any excuses,\" Holik said, \"but I was never on the power play and they used me on the checking line in the playoffs.\n",
      "I want to come in and work as hard as I can, show Herb Brooks that I deserve to get a place on the team\".\n",

      "THERE is an exquisite cousin to lemons and limes that is quite at home in my backyard garden in Brooklyn.\n",
      "Some people around here, however, aren't attracted to it for its citrus lineage; they like it for its relationship to razor ribbon.\n",
      "The plant, known as Poncirus trifoliata, or trifoliate orange, is theft-proof.\n",
      "Would-be urban bush-rustlers might end up slashed by one-inch long, needle-sharp thorns that lie in wait just beneath a shroud of shiny green leaflets.\n",
      "Planted beneath windows, it might be equally discouraging to a housebreaker.\n",
      "Several trifoliate orange shrubs were planted in the 1960's inside the fence at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden in a successful effort to discourage trespassers.\n",
      "This versatile shrub or small tree from northern China was popular until the post-war building boom, when house after house settled for mirror-image plantings of standard hemlocks and yews.\n",
      "For a while, it served as the under-stock for grafting commercial citrus varieties.\n",
      "But to me, its charm is purely esthetic.\n",
      "In spring, one- to two-inch star-shaped fragrant flowers cover the branches.\n",
      "After the petals drop, little mossy marblelike fruits form.\n",
      "The three-part leaves start out grass-green and deepen in color to a park-bench green as the round fruits swell through the summer, ultimately reaching two inches in diameter.\n",
      "Unlike the subtropical evergreen citrus varieties, the hardy trifoliate orange is deciduous.\n",
      "Its leaves and fruits turn yellow in autumn, but after the leaves fall, the pretty fruits remain to deck the branches like Christmas tree ornaments.\n",
      "Sadly, the aromatic fruits are merely a decorative bonus.\n",
      "They are not tasty -- too sour to eat off the bush -- but can be harvested for marmalade or to garnish beverages.\n",
      "Older plants take on a wonderful winding form with sinewy trunks and striped green and light brown bark.\n",
      "\"They get muscular as they get older,\" said Edmond Moulin, director of horticulture at the Brooklyn Botanic Garden.\n",
      "The oldest Poncirus there, planted in 1914, grows at the base of a hill west of the Steinhardt Conservatory.\n",
      "There are a number of examples at the garden, including several that form one spoke of the \"hedge wheel,\" a demonstration planting of shrubs for home gardens.\n",
      "The trifoliate orange takes well to pruning and training.\n",
      "At Meadowbrook Farm near Philadelphia, Liddon Pennock has created a border of Poncirus trained and trimmed into five-foot-tall standards: topiaries in a lollipop shape.\n",
      "At the noted Wave Hill estate in the Bronx, a seedling planted to be espaliered against a wall has grown into a solid column of foliage that has to be sheared in spring and occasionally through the season; otherwise it would be a hazard to workers and visitors.\n",
      "In spite of this treatment, it manages to flower and fruit.\n",
      "Since Poncirus plants are rarely sold at garden centers these days, the fruits present an easy way to get these plants.\n",
      "Like many citrus, it is easy to propagate from seeds; the fruits are filled with them.\n",
      "If you know where one grows, get permission from the owner to pick a ripe fruit, or collect one off the ground from late fall to early spring.\n",
      "Fallen fruits collected after winter will be ready to germinate.\n",
      "I have collected fruits with seeds already sprouted inside.\n",
      "But success is guaranteed with \"stratified\" ripe seeds.\n",
      "Stratification, often necessary for seeds of cold-climate plants, is a process by which seeds are exposed to chilling and warming to fool them into thinking they've been through a winter.\n",
      "Carefully cut open the ripe yellow fruit, then remove the seeds and wash them thoroughly.\n",
      "Sow them on their sides about one-half inch deep in a three- or four-inch plastic flower pot filled with moist commercial starting mix (made from peat moss, vermiculite and perlite).\n",
      "Place the pot in a plastic bag in the refrigerator for two or three months.\n",
      "Then move the planted container to a sunny window, and keep the mix moist but not soggy.\n",
      "Within a few weeks, the seeds should sprout.\n",
      "\"Seed\" leaves appear first, followed by the distinctive three-parted \"true\" leaves.\n",
      "If you have several seedlings growing in one pot, carefully separate them after the leaves unfurl.\n",
      "The young specimens make beautiful house plants and will grow well on a sunny windowsill through the winter, providing the temperature is cool -- below 60 degrees Fahrenheit at night.\n",
      "Outdoors, the trifoliate orange appreciates an acidic, well-drained soil, similar to the type enjoyed by rhododendrons.\n",
      "It dislikes cultivation close to its shallow roots.\n",
      "It will do well with six hours or more of direct sunlight a day, and it tolerates dry or moist conditions.\n",
      "\"It really isn't all that fussy, and has no pest problems,\" Mr. Moulin said.\n",
      "The plants can grow up to 35 feet tall, but rarely do, making them a good choice for small properties.\n",
      "Eight feet tall and nearly as wide is more the norm within the plant's preferred hardiness range of United States Department of Agriculture zones 5 to 9; that could be outdoors in New York City as well as in a warm-temperate garden in Berkeley, Calif.\n",
      ", or a protected spot against a sunny wall in Boston.\n",
      "A few mail-order suppliers carry Poncirus, and some growers say they have noticed a renewed interest in the plant.\n",
      "There is even a new grafted variety called Flying Dragon, which has twisted, contorted stems.\n",
      "For now, you'll have to ask your garden center to try to order one, or seek small plants from one of these sources: Logee's Greenhouses, 141 North Street, Danielson, Conn.\n",
      "06239 (catalogue $3); or Forest Farm, 990 Tetherow Road, Williams, Ore.\n",
      "97544-9599 (catalogue $2).\n",
      "You could always grow your own from seeds.\n",
      "It is worth the effort, for the plants are vigorous once established.\n",
      "To paraphrase the song: this \"lemon\" tree \"very pretty,\" and the flowers do smell sweet, but the fruits of this bold citrus are impossible to eat.\n",
      "And the thorns can be lethal, although they may have other uses than deterring intruders.\n",
      "Judith Zuk, the president of the Brooklyn Botanic Garden, remembers that when she was a student, her professor used to cut off a branch in December and stick gumdrops on all the thorns.\n",
      "\"It was the most unorthodox Christmas tree I ever saw,\" she said.\n",
      "\"We all loved it\".\n",
      "Photos: Planted beneath windows, the trifoliate orange plant, with its one-inch-long, needle-sharp thorns, might be discouraging to a burglar.\n",

      "THE perspective provided by a show at the Katonah Museum of Art should prove valuable to voters \"coming down\" from the conventions.\n",
      "Titled \"In Good Conscience: The Radical Tradition in 20th-Century American Illustration,\" the exhibition proposes in the clearest possible terms that while times change the issues remain the same.\n",
      "It was organized for the museum by Bernard Reilly Jr., head curator of prints and photographs at the Library of Congress.\n",
      "Imperialism, war, capital punishment, unemployment, destitution, racism -- all the ills are here (except drug addiction, abortion and AIDS) that artists have been covering all century long.\n",
      "In 1927, for example, Hugo Gellert did a collage for a New Masses cover that involved a map of Mexico, a compass in the form of a skull and crossbones and the legend, \"Is oil thicker than blood\"?\n",
      "If there is a difference between then and now it is in the more impassioned styles of earlier artists.\n",
      "John Sloan comments on the massacre that ended a strike at the John D. Rockefeller Fuel and Iron Company in Ludlow, Colo.\n",
      ", with a brisk 1914 sketch in black chalk of a miner who stands in a wrecked house grasping a dead child and firing a handgun.\n",
      "Reflecting similar outrage, Robert Minor sums up the Pittsburgh steelworkers strike of 1916 with an equally swift chalk sketch of a man impaled on the bayonet of a National Guardsman.\n",
      "Compared with these, Sue Coe's \"War\" (1991) is tame stuff, being a neat design of a woman with head bowed and a sea of gas-masked faces under a sky black with warplanes.\n",
      "Nor does the pulse beat faster at the sight of Marshall Arisman's \"Old Man on Park Bench Eating Dog Food\" (1977); the artist has devoted too much care to the can opener lying beside the man.\n",
      "Since industrialization and the population growth it fosters are its chief prerequisites, the art of political and social comment developed later in the United States than in Europe.\n",
      "Daumier, a caricaturist who was jailed for his pains, and Gustave Dore had long since made their marks by the time Thomas Nast began contributing to Harper's Weekly.\n",
      "Mr. Reilly notes in his brochure introduction that the German-born Nast was the first social critic in American art, but that he was \"less a champion of the common man than a loyal advocate of republican ideology\".\n",
      "It was left to Robert Henri and the Ashcan painters to focus on the ever-widening gap between rich and poor, and they, in turn, passed the baton to The Masses, which had Sloan for art editor and artists like Minor, George Bellows and the young Stuart Davis for contributors.\n",
      "The Masses died in 1917, but the dissent continued -- notably in The Nation, which employed Adolf Dehn and Louis Lozowick, among others, and of course in The New Masses.\n",
      "Not surprisingly, the vintage period for dissent in this show extends from the mid-1920's to the mid-1930's.\n",
      "Reginald Marsh reports sedately on bread lines (for a New Yorker of 1928), Philip Evergood on derelicts (1932), James Daughterty on police brutality (1932) and Paul Cadmus on lynching (1925).\n",
      "More interesting esthetically, however, is Philip Guston's 1930 drawing of a Ku Klux Klan hanging, because it all but proves the artist's 1970's departure from Abstract Expressionism to figuration to have been a reversion.\n",
      "Jacob Lawrence speaks for the 1950's with a large gouache of a window that has flies and a dead mouse on the inside and gives on to a view of tenements packed tighter than sardines in a can.\n",
      "Ben Shahn does the same with a revised pen-and-ink version of his famous 1931-32 painting, \"Nicola Sacco and Bartolomeo Vanzetti\".\n",
      "After this, and despite fine drawings by Antonio Frasconi and David Levine, the show loses momentum.\n",
      "It would appear that the most eloquent commentators of the last 30 years have been photographers.\n",
      "After closing here on Sept.\n",
      "27, the show travels to the Hood Museum of Art at Dartmouth College.\n",
      "Also at the museum is a retrospective by Alan Cober, who is dubbed \"The Artist as Illustrator, the Illustrator as Journalist\".\n",
      "The guest curator for this is Steven Heller, who is editor of the A.I.G.A.\n",
      "Journal of Graphic Design and Design and Style, as well as a senior art director at The New York Times.\n",
      "The recipient of numerous graphic arts awards, Mr. Cober is currently a professor of art and distinguished visiting artist at the State University of New York at Buffalo.\n",
      "His other accomplishments include covers for Time and Newsweek, posters, a mural for the National Museum of American History and a book on Willowbrook, the state mental hospital, that is titled \"The Forgotten Society\".\n",
      "He covered the 1980 Presidential election.\n",
      "Mr. Heller calls him a \"maverick\" who \"played a crucial role in changing the practice and perception of commercial and editorial illustration\".\n",
      "To an outside observer, however, Mr. Cober is part of the figural trend that has its roots in Picasso, Goya, the German New Objectivity Movement and the sculpture of Marino Marini.\n",
      "Named the \"Outsider Movement\" by the historian Selden Rodman, the mode took on in the United States after World War II only to be shunted aside by Abstract Expressionism.\n",
      "It is a heroic form of realism that seems always to be pointing to a moral and it has attracted artists from Jose Luis Cuevas to Rico Lebrun and Leonard Baskin and may now be attracting a new generation of painters and sculptors.\n",
      "Nevertheless, its influence seems to have been strongest in the graphic world.\n",
      "Whether working with pencil and watercolor, pen and ink or an etching needle, Mr. Cober is ever the rigorous draftsman but with a highly subjective approach.\n",
      "The 1975 portraits of the aging Joe Louis in pen and colored inks are evidently faithful to life; but the \"villain\" of the 1980's, Michael Milken, is depicted as a junkie mainlining money.\n",
      "Mr. Cober frequently departs without warning into his own Surrealist imagination, as in the profile of a man whose nose is metamorphosing into crab's legs and in the portrait of himself wearing the shell of a horseshoe crab.\n",
      "There are few images not tinged with the bizarre, whether it is the beautifully worked portrait heads on shriveled bodies or the men wearing hats, tight overcoats and masks who are forcing Martin Luther King away.\n",
      "The artist, however, can produce amazingly cool drawings of machinery.\n",
      "Indeed, the key to understanding Mr. Cober's mind may well be in the labyrinthine hand-colored etchings of engines.\n",
      "This show remains on view through Sept.\n",

      "Call 232-9555 for information.\n",
      "\"Warnings,\" at Nardin Fine Arts in Cross River, was to have been a companion to the Cober show, but for reasons unclear has metamorphosed into an anthology of paintings, drawings, prints, sculpture and photographs, and the same title serves.\n",
      "As with the \"Conscience\" exhibition at Katonah, the time span is considerable, but the artists are contemporary, most of them living in Westchester.\n",

      "Once a week, Lyn Forester gets down on her knees, clears the cigarette butts, candy wrappers and beer cans away from the base of a stark wooden cross and holds a quiet vigil for her daughter, who was killed here in a car accident eight years ago.\n",
      "Her ankles dangling from the curb as tractor-trailers hurtle past just feet away, Mrs. Forester says she knows it is both dangerous and illegal to visit this three-foot-wide median along Highway 141 near Wilmington, Del.\n",
      "But she cannot stay away.\n",
      "''This is where my daughter's spirit was last,'' Mrs. Forester said, straightening up the plastic flowers and Christmas tree cuttings potted at the base of the shrine for her daughter, Jenni.\n",
      "''I'm more drawn to this spot than I am even to the cemetery where we keep her remains.''\n",
      "Roadside memorials like Mrs. Forester's have become so numerous, and so distracting and dangerous, highway officials say, that more and more states are trying to regulate them.\n",
      "Some, like Montana and California, allow the memorials, but only if alcohol was a factor in the crash.\n",
      "Others, like Wisconsin and New Jersey, limit how long the memorials can remain in place.\n",
      "Now, in a move that is being watched by other states, Delaware is taking a different approach, establishing a memorial park near a highway exit in hopes of discouraging the roadside shrines.\n",
      "The park will include a reflection pool and red bricks -- provided free to the loved ones of highway accident victims -- with names inscripted to honor the dead.\n",
      "Just 20 years ago, such intervention by states was unheard of, said Arthur Jipson, who has studied laws governing the memorials and is director of the criminal justice studies program at the University of Dayton in Ohio.\n",
      "Now, Mr. Jipson said, 22 states have such legislation, and the number has more than doubled in the past five years.\n",
      "The efforts, however, have forced local officials into a delicate balancing act.\n",
      "''Governments are reluctant to tell people what to feel or how to mourn,'' Mr. Jipson said.\n",
      "''At the same time, it's their job to keep these spaces public.''\n",
      "The popularity of the memorials has spawned a cottage industry on the Internet, with Web sites like roadsidememorials.com selling mail-order crosses to families that do not want to construct their own.\n",
      "Roadside Memorials warns customers that it ''will not be responsible for any accidents or injuries due to the placement of your cross.''\n",
      "For some, the markers are poignant reminders to drive slowly and a small price to pay to help ease the anguish of loss.\n",
      "But to others, they are macabre eyesores and dangerous distractions that invite rubbernecking and visitors to already hazardous roads.\n",
      "Highway officials also say the memorials frequently get in the way of road crews cutting grass or clearing snow.\n",
      "Other critics challenge their legality.\n",
      "''For us, the memorials raise serious church-state constitutional concerns because they usually feature religious symbols and are placed on state property,'' said Robert R. Tiernan, a lawyer with the Freedom From Religion Foundation in Madison, Wis.\n",
      ", who successfully defended a Denver man arrested in 2001 after he removed a religious roadside memorial.\n",
      "''I'm sympathetic to people who have faced this kind of grief,'' added Mr. Tiernan, whose 13-year-old son died after a car accident in 1981.\n",
      "''But the public space belongs to everyone, and I think it's important to honor that.''\n",
      "Debby Lewkowitz, whose 16-year old son, Adam, died in a car accident in January 2004, cites purely personal justification for her memorial.\n",
      "''My daughter's school bus used to pass by this spot every day, and I still do when I drive to work,'' Ms. Lewkowitz said, standing beside the weathered bouquet of plastic flowers and silk butterflies she had attached to a wooden post and placed alongside an overpass of Interstate 95 in Newark, Del.\n",
      "''Unfortunately, the memory of my son is here, and to let it go unmarked simply hurts too much.''\n",
      "With no federal law governing the placement of the markers, state officials have been left to negotiate the issue on their own.\n",
      "Florida, Colorado and Texas will erect a nonreligious marker at the scene of a death.\n",
      "Missouri allows memorials but encourages victims' families to participate in the state's adopt-a-highway program instead.\n",
      "Delaware hopes that its memorial garden will discourage the shrines.\n",
      "''Our philosophy is that we want to keep our roads clean and safe, and to do that we want to encourage people to have a safe location where they can mourn,'' said Darrel Cole, a spokesman for the Delaware Department of Transportation.\n",
      "Construction on the Delaware Highway Memorial Garden began in late 2004 but was halted last year because of a budget shortfall.\n",
      "The 11,000-square-foot garden will be at the Smyrna rest area along U.S. 13, the Dupont Highway, between Dover and Wilmington and will cost $75,000.\n",
      "Benches will surround the reflection pool, and a footpath will contain the inscripted red bricks.\n",
      "Mr. Cole said that although state legislators enacted a law last year imposing a $25 fine for unauthorized use of state roadways, road crews tried not to single out memorials, focusing instead on removing illegal advertisements and political signs.\n",
      "For Peter Medwick, an administrator at Wesley College in Dover, that is not enough.\n",
      "Memorials are for cemeteries, not highways, Mr. Medwick said, and it is the state's responsibility to keep roadways clean.\n",
      "''The shrines are often left unattended for long periods,'' he said, recounting some he had seen with deflated balloons, soggy teddy bears nailed to crosses and photographs in Ziploc bags.\n",
      "''It can get really over the top and ghoulish.''\n",
      "Often called ''descansos,'' a Spanish word for ''resting places,'' roadside memorials are most common in the American Southwest.\n",
      "Most researchers believe they descend from a Spanish tradition in which pallbearers left stones or crosses to mark where they rested as they carried a coffin by foot from the church to the cemetery.\n",
      "Because of this heritage, the memorials are protected in New Mexico as ''traditional cultural properties'' by the state's Historic Preservation Division.\n",
      "Mr. Jipson said that while no national survey had been conducted of the memorials, most transportation officials agreed that their numbers had grown in recent years.\n",
      "An informal study by the Maryland Department of Transportation in 2004 estimated that markers were erected after 10 percent to 20 percent of fatal crashes.\n",
      "Sylvia Grider, a folklorist and anthropologist at Texas A&M University who has studied the history of the memorials, said their rising popularity in the United States was part of a growing acceptance of public mourning.\n",
      "''Something happened in American culture when the Vietnam Wall went up and there was an outpouring of offerings in front of it that no one was expecting,'' Ms. Grider said.\n",
      "''It became more acceptable to express personal grief in these public areas.''\n",
      "The Internet has also fostered interest in the memorials.\n",
      "Countless Web sites feature extensive photo galleries of memorials from around the world.\n",
      "Jacquelyn Quiram, of Shorewood, Ill.\n",
      ", said she had sold several hundred crosses in the past year since starting Roadside Memorials.\n",
      "The three-foot crosses are stained brown oak or painted, and, at $80, they come mounted with a bouquet of cloth flowers and a picture frame.\n",

      "Last December, she self-published a book that includes more than 180 stories and photographs, and she said she had sold several hundred copies on the Internet.\n",
      "While many states have adopted rules regarding the memorials in recent years, Melissa Villanueva, a filmmaker from Kansas City, Mo.\n",

      "This week, jurors will hear a narrative told once before, by a prosecutor who gripped the hand of the victim's mother and then gave this account: In April 2003, a 21-year-old Hunter College student named Romona Moore was reported missing from her home in East Flatbush.\n",
      "The police did not take the report seriously.\n",
      "Mr. Pearson and Mr. Hendrix lured Ms. Moore to a house on Snyder Avenue, dragged her to the basement, chained her by the neck and arms, stripped her to a sweatshirt, covered her in a sheet, fed her pills, showed her off to a friend visiting from out of town, cut the webbing between her fingers and killed her with eight blows from a hammer.\n",
      "Mr. Hendrix raped her corpse.\n",
      "Her body was left beneath an ice cream truck.\n",

      "New complications developed.\n",
      "Setting rules for a retrial, Justice Tomei described for the record his own observations of the escape attempt, pausing at times, scanning the ceiling to recall: ''There were shouts of 'He's going for the gun  he's going for the gun.\n",
      "' ''  Last week, a prosecutor sought to use the escape attempt to show the defendants worked as partners.\n",
      "Defense lawyers argued that the judge's own statement could then come into question.\n",

      "Other convolutions he could not prevent.\n",
      "As in the original trial, two juries must sit together, each leaving the room for testimony inadmissible against its assigned defendant.\n",
      "Seeking to overcome each man's defense that he played a lesser role, the prosecution theory holds that each intended the outcome and was equally culpable.\n",
      "The strategy is an uncompromising gamble, legal experts say, for juries given those terms tend to accept the prosecution's framework, if not its preferred verdict.\n",
      "''They never seem to consider it separately,'' said Laurie Gilbertson, a former prosecutor in Queens.\n",
      "''It's just: Did they do it, together, or not do it, together?''\n",
      "From a juror's vantage, much of the strange courtroom imagery goes unexplained.\n",

      "In a burst of static and feedback, Mr. Pearson will appear on the right, lolling his head, cracking his joints, seeming now and again to fall asleep.\n",
      "The courtroom speakers will produce the sound of rattling chains, a lawyer will mutter a joke about the Ghost of Christmas Past, and then Mr. Hendrix will appear on the left, peering up through dark-rimmed glasses.\n",

      "Japanese television showed seven of the Chinese citizens landing in Hong Kong on a commercial flight.\n",
      "The Japanese authorities said that the other seven were put back on the boat they had used to reach the island and were being escorted out of Japanese waters by the coast guard.\n",
      "The 14, who included activists and journalists based in Hong Kong, were arrested on Wednesday after seven of them arrived by boat on Uotsuri, part of an uninhabited island chain in the East China Sea called the Senkakus by Japan and Diaoyu by China.\n",
      "The islands are controlled by Japan, but are also claimed by China and Taiwan.\n",
      "Five of the Chinese were arrested on the island, and the other nine on the boat, including two who had stepped ashore.\n",
      "By deporting the 14 so soon after their arrest, Japan appeared to be trying to quickly end a potential diplomatic crisis.\n",
      "Chinese officials also appeared interested in keeping the episode from growing into a full-blown spat, demanding the immediate release of the 14 but seeming to avoid an escalation of harsh words.\n",
      "Even protests in front of Japanese diplomatic missions in China were small and relatively muted compared with past demonstrations.\n",
      "Tokyo also appeared eager to avert a bruising standoff similar to one that began two years ago after Japanese authorities arrested a Chinese trawler captain in waters off the same islands.\n",
      "That episode grew into a two-week-long diplomatic showdown, which China appeared to win after detaining Japanese businessmen and cutting off exports to Japan of rare earth metals used in making electronics.\n",

      "But buying at the southern tip of the Baja California peninsula these days involves a gamble on who will win the drug war.\n",
      "''The media is painting Mexico with too broad of a brush,'' says Marc Rodriguez, general manager of the five-star Esperanza Resort, which in June hosted the U.S. delegation, including President Barack Obama and the secretary of state, Hillary Rodham Clinton, during a Group of 20 industrialized nations meeting.\n",
      "''This country has its problems, but we are safe here.''\n",
      "Jon Legg, a Canadian banker, says he did not hesitate to spend slightly less than $1 million for a three-bedroom unit totaling 186 square meters, or 2,000 square feet, in the newly developed Hacienda Beach Club & Residences in Cabo San Lucas.\n",
      "''I've been coming to Cabo for over a decade, and feel just as safe here, as I do at home,'' Mr. Legg said.\n",
      "This year, Mr. Legg's unit and six other homes have sold in the development, for a total of $15 million.\n",
      "(While pesos are used for most Mexican sales, top-end projects usually are priced in U.S. dollars.\n",
      ")  The U.S. Department of State has posted a detailed travel warning for Mexico but, while travelers are cautioned about visiting much of Baja California, the document says ''no advisory is in effect'' for Cabo San Lucas.\n",
      "Canada generally advises caution when visiting the country, but does say that nonessential travel to northern states, including northern Baja California, should be avoided.\n",
      "In October 2011 six people died in a series of gun battles in a Cabo San Lucas shopping mall but the incident was never proven to be drug related.\n",
      "However, it is known that several of Mexico's prominent drug lords use Los Cabos as their own refuge.\n",
      "In fact, while Mrs. Clinton was about 400 yards, or 366 meters, away, Mexican officials went door-to-door looking for Joaquín Guzmán, also known as ''El Chapo,'' the head ofthe Sinaloa cartel.\n",
      "The search was unsuccessful.\n",
      "''Los Cabos is safe because it is under the rule of one drug cartel, the Sinaloa Federation,'' says Sylvia Longmire, author of ''Cartel,'' which was published by Palgrave Macmillan in 2011.\n",
      "The security specialist and consultant also notes that Los Cabos is not a drug port -- unlike Acapulco (where the local real estate association says prices are down 44 percent from the start of this year).\n",
      "That resort is the shipping point for most of the world's supply of cocaine from Colombia.\n",
      "However, she added, ''The drug cartel landscape is very volatile and can change within six months.\n",
      "When two cartels fight for control of an area, it results in killings.''\n",
      "For now, at least, ''If you want to go and stay at a five-star resort or housing complex, you're secure,'' Ms. Longmire said.\n",
      "''It's when you go outside that you put yourself in danger.''\n",
      "Many developments and resorts have put a lot of effort into security arrangements in recent years, not all immediately visible to homeowners or guests.\n",
      "At Esperanza, for example, there are two entry checkpoints, guards roam the beach, and there are hidden cameras in the gardens.\n",
      "Yet even though the resort has not had a significant crime problem, prices for its fractional ownership units have dropped 30 percent since 2006.\n",
      "Six weeks a year in a two-bedroom luxury unit with marble bathrooms and a Jacuzzi now sells for $200,000, plus annual fees.\n",

      "Mr. Ahmed did not tell the neighbors about his plans until the initial permits were approved by the city and construction was under way.\n",
      "When they found out, from a worker on the site, they protested to the community board and rallied in opposition.\n",

      "Though its construction has been slowed by frequent complaints to the city's 311 help line, and the constant need to raise money -- he estimated $500,000 had been spent on the building so far -- he was hopeful the mosque would open next spring.\n",

      "Mitt Romney doesn't see dead people.\n",
      "But that's only because he doesn't want to see them; if he did, he'd have to acknowledge the ugly reality of what will happen if he and Paul Ryan get their way on health care.\n",
      "Last week, speaking to The Columbus Dispatch, Mr. Romney declared that nobody in America dies because he or she is uninsured: ''We don't have people that become ill, who die in their apartment because they don't have insurance.''\n",
      "This followed on an earlier remark by Mr. Romney -- echoing an infamous statement by none other than George W. Bush -- in which he insisted that emergency rooms provide essential health care to the uninsured.\n",
      "These are remarkable statements.\n",
      "They clearly demonstrate that Mr. Romney has no idea what life (and death) are like for those less fortunate than himself.\n",
      "Even the idea that everyone gets urgent care when needed from emergency rooms is false.\n",
      "Yes, hospitals are required by law to treat people in dire need, whether or not they can pay.\n",
      "But that care isn't free -- on the contrary, if you go to an emergency room you will be billed, and the size of that bill can be shockingly high.\n",
      "Some people can't or won't pay, but fear of huge bills can deter the uninsured from visiting the emergency room even when they should.\n",
      "And sometimes they die as a result.\n",
      "More important, going to the emergency room when you're very sick is no substitute for regular care, especially if you have chronic health problems.\n",
      "When such problems are left untreated -- as they often are among uninsured Americans -- a trip to the emergency room can all too easily come too late to save a life.\n",
      "So the reality, to which Mr. Romney is somehow blind, is that many people in America really do die every year because they don't have health insurance.\n",
      "How many deaths are we talking about?\n",
      "That's not an easy question to answer, and conservatives love to cite the handful of studies that fail to find clear evidence that insurance saves lives.\n",
      "The overwhelming evidence, however, is that insurance is indeed a lifesaver, and lack of insurance a killer.\n",
      "For example, states that expand their Medicaid coverage, and hence provide health insurance to more people, consistently show a significant drop in mortality compared with neighboring states that don't expand coverage.\n",
      "And surely the fact that the United States is the only major advanced nation without some form of universal health care is at least part of the reason life expectancy is much lower in America than in Canada or Western Europe.\n",
      "So there's no real question that lack of insurance is responsible for thousands, and probably tens of thousands, of excess deaths of Americans each year.\n",
      "But that's not a fact Mr. Romney wants to admit, because he and his running mate want to repeal Obamacare and slash funding for Medicaid -- actions that would take insurance away from some 45 million nonelderly Americans, causing thousands of people to suffer premature death.\n",
      "And their longer-term plans to convert Medicare into Vouchercare would deprive many seniors of adequate coverage, too, leading to still more unnecessary mortality.\n",
      "Oh, about the voucher thing: In his debate with Vice President Biden, Mr. Ryan was actually the first one to mention vouchers, attempting to rule the term out of bounds.\n",
      "Indeed, it's apparently the party line on the right that anyone using the word ''voucher'' to describe a health policy in which you're given a fixed sum to apply to health insurance is a liar, not to mention a big meanie.\n",
      "Among the lying liars, then, is the guy who, in 2009, described the Ryan plan as a matter of ''converting Medicare into a defined contribution sort of voucher system.''\n",
      "Oh, wait -- that was Paul Ryan himself.\n",
      "And what if the vouchers -- for that's what they are -- turned out not to be large enough to pay for adequate insurance?\n",
      "Then those who couldn't afford to top up the vouchers sufficiently -- a group that would include many, and probably most, older Americans -- would be left with inadequate insurance, insurance that exposed them to severe financial hardship if they got sick, sometimes left them unable to afford crucial care, and yes, sometimes led to their early death.\n",
      "So let's be brutally honest here.\n",
      "The Romney-Ryan position on health care is that many millions of Americans must be denied health insurance, and millions more deprived of the security Medicare now provides, in order to save money.\n",
      "At the same time, of course, Mr. Romney and Mr. Ryan are proposing trillions of dollars in tax cuts for the wealthy.\n",
      "So a literal description of their plan is that they want to expose many Americans to financial insecurity, and let some of them die, so that a handful of already wealthy people can have a higher after-tax income.\n",
      "It's not a pretty picture -- and you can see why Mr. Romney chooses not to see it.\n",

      "One is the access the filmmakers had to the campaigns of both sides.\n",
      "The other is the relatively small amount of ranting and crazy talk.\n",
      "There is a lot of reasoned opinion here, and an equal amount that may not be reasoned but is certainly heartfelt.\n",
      "After the Maine Legislature approved same-sex marriage, groups opposed to the law put the issue to a referendum, and Mr. Fox and Mr. Nubile began filming.\n",
      "The documentary's most intriguing element is the doubt, bluntly expressed, that some on the repeal side have about the wisdom of taking a stand that will inevitably be perceived as antigay, and about the tactics being used by Schubert-Flint Public Affairs, the outside consultants directing their efforts.\n",
      "Some viewers will be frustrated by the film's determination to be evenhanded, but with this same battle likely to be fought repeatedly in the coming years (the issue is again on the 2012 Maine ballot), ''Question One'' stands as a pretty good primer in how referendums are won and lost.\n",

      "I've lived in Santa Fe for five years, and I know of no other town with a tourism- and restaurant-driven economy that relies so heavily on one ingredient.\n",
      "In the fall, the whole town smells of the rich smoke of fresh green chiles being broiled in rotisserie-style roasters: Big Jim, a fat pepper that's perfect for chiles rellenos; sandias, hotter and smaller, good for stews; Joe E. Parkers, which fall along the milder end of the spice spectrum.\n",

      "I stopped at Fred's Socorro Chile, which sells about 1,000 bushels a week during harvest season and helps supply some of Santa Fe's top restaurants.\n",
      "I bought a half-bushel of Socorro Big Jim chiles the size of flashlights for $25.\n",

Weakland of Milwaukee asked the Vatican yesterday to speed up his retirement, hours after a man gave a television interview saying the archbishop had sexually assaulted him when he was a 33-year-old graduate student, then paid him $450,000 in 1998 in a confidential settlement.\n",
      "The accusation is the first direct accusation of sexual misconduct against an American archbishop since the sexual abuse scandal in the Roman Catholic Church began in January.\n",
      "Archbishop Weakland denied the claim of sexual misconduct.\n",
      "He is the nation's most outspokenly liberal archbishop, an intellectual maverick who often infuriated the Vatican by pressing for the church to consider liturgical changes and the ordination of women and married men.\n",
      "His accuser, Paul Marcoux, 54, said in an interview on ABC's \"Good Morning America\" that 20 years ago he had gone to Archbishop Weakland for advice on entering the priesthood, and that the archbishop committed what amounted to \"date rape\" after dinner in the archbishop's apartment.\n",
      "In a statement released yesterday, Archbishop Weakland said, \"I have never abused anyone\".\n",
      "\"Paul Marcoux has made reference to a settlement agreement between us,\" he added.\n",
      "\"Because I accept the agreement's confidentiality provision, I will make no comment about its content\".\n",

      "The amount of the settlement is far more than the archdiocese has offered to others who said they were sexually abused by priests in Milwaukee, victims' advocates said.\n",
      "In his statement, the archbishop sought to pre-empt criticism that church money had been used to pay off Mr. Marcoux, saying that over the years he had turned over to the archdiocese the money he had earned from lectures and writing, and that \"cumulatively, those moneys far exceed any settlement amount\".\n",
      "Archbishop Weakland, appointed to his position 25 years ago by Pope Paul VI, formally submitted his request for retirement to the Vatican on April 2, when he turned 75.\n",

      "An anguished personal letter the archbishop wrote to Mr. Marcoux on Aug.\n",
      "25, 1980 -- made public by a longtime critic of the archbishop -- seems to indicate that the two men had been involved in a long-running emotional relationship that ended when the archbishop resolved to return to his commitment to celibacy.\n",
      "\"I feel like the world's worst hypocrite,\" he wrote.\n",
      "\"So gradually I came back to the importance of celibacy in my life -- not just a physical celibacy but the freedom the celibate commitment gives\".\n",
      "\"I knew I would have to face up to it and take seriously that commitment I first made 34 years ago.\n",
      "I found my task as priest-archbishop almost unbearable these months and I came to realize that I was at a crossroads -- and I knew I had to get the courage to decide.\n",
      "There is no other way for me to live, Paul.\n",
      "Ridicule me if you must -- I am expecting it\".\n",
      "In the letter the archbishop says that he had already given Mr. Marcoux $14,000 in personal funds, and could not in good conscience supply him with any archdiocesan money.\n",
      "The letter indicates that Mr. Marcoux was asking for money to back an entrepreneurial video project he called \"Christodrama\".\n",
      "\"I feel you are putting me in an impossible situation here,\" the archbishop wrote.\n",
      "\"I consider all that church money as a sacred trust; it represents the offerings of the faithful and I must be accountable to them for how it is all spent\".\n",
      "The settlement and the letter were described in the \"Good Morning America\" report, and the texts of both were later posted on the Web site of The Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel, which said that a handwriting analyst had confirmed that Archbishop Weakland wrote the letter.\n",
      "The letter was given to news outlets by Peter Isley, a sexual abuse victim and a vocal critic of Archbishop Weakland.\n",
      "Mr Isley, the Milwaukee representative of the Survivors Network of those Abused by Priests, said that he had never met or spoken with Mr. Marcoux and that the letter had been delivered to his house anonymously.\n",
      "He would not say when he received the letter.\n",
      "\"I took it as a kind of insurance, in case they came after me,\" Mr. Isley said.\n",
      "\"This is yet another piece of evidence in a pattern of behavior and action documented for over 15 years that Archbishop Weakland and many other bishops have been thoroughly compromised on the issue of sexual abuse and misconduct\".\n",
      "Mr. Marcoux, who has lived in San Francisco and Michigan, did not respond to requests for an interview.\n",
      "The lawyer who represented him in the settlement, Brent D. Tyler of Montreal, said that he had been advised by his client and an American lawyer to say nothing.\n",

      "Long a point of national pride, the sterling reputation of Japan's food industry has been tarnished in recent months by scandals tumbling out one after the other: four cases of mad cow disease, most recently in mid-May here in Japan's farming heartland; Brazilian chicken labeled as Japanese; Vietnamese salt labeled as Japanese; mixed rice labeled as single-variety; American beef sold as Japanese.\n",
      "National concern about food quality has risen sharply as a result, with newspapers and consumers starting to demand an overhaul of the system that is said to guarantee pure food -- a matter of national pride.\n",
      "One major recent case in which beef was mislabeled to earn government subsidies pushed one of Japan's most reliable household standbys, the Snow Brand Food Company, into bankruptcy, and led to the arrest of seven former officers.\n",
      "The company's mother ship, the Snow Brand Milk Products Company, which was formed in 1925, is flirting with bankruptcy.\n",
      "Two years ago, thousands of people reported having suffered food poisoning after it was disclosed that the company had distributed spoiled milk.\n",
      "\"Food is something you put into your mouth -- a brand becomes popular if it has the trust of the people,\" Joji Tsugai, Snow Brand's regional consumer complaints director, said in the half-empty offices of regional headquarters here.\n",
      "\"We lost the trust in our brand\".\n",
      "Although Japanese pride themselves as heirs to inborn knowledge about such foods as rice and fish, most cases of food mislabeling have been uncovered by government inspectors.\n",
      "For example, a yearlong government survey of 113,581 rice retailers concluded in May that 15 percent had been selling mislabeled rice.\n",
      "In another case, it was disclosed that the Marubeni Chikusan Corporation had sold Brazilian chicken as Japanese for 20 years.\n",
      "A sailors' union survey of fish shops last November found that only 10 percent of packages of sliced raw tuna were correctly labeled.\n",
      "For decades, Japanese have accepted paying high prices for domestically produced food on the theory that it was purer than imported food.\n",
      "Now, some city dwellers complain they are paying sky-high prices simply to subsidize inefficient farms.\n",
      "With Japan's government dependent on votes from rural districts across this island, Hokkaido, the government does not dream of opening floodgates to food imports.\n",
      "Last June, Agriculture Ministry officials openly ridiculed a European Union report warning that Japan was a prime candidate for mad cow disease.\n",
      "Three months later, on Sept.\n",
      "10, Asia's first case was discovered, on a farm near Tokyo.\n",
      "Now, the government estimates that the mad cow outbreak has cost farmers, meat packers, supermarkets and restaurants $2 billion over the last eight months.\n",
      "All four cases of mad cow disease, three in Hokkaido, were traced back to a milk-substitute feed given to the cows when they were calves in the spring of 1996.\n",
      "The blended feed contained an animal fat from the Netherlands, which has had 21 cases of mad cow disease since 1997.\n",
      "In 1996, the World Health Organization urged Japan and other countries to ban the use of such cow byproducts as feed.\n",
      "Japan made the ban voluntary.\n",
      "Since last October, Japan has checked all cattle taken to slaughter for mad cow disease.\n",
      "But about 40 percent of Japan's 168 slaughterhouses now refuse to accept older cattle for fear of contamination.\n",
      "As a result, some older cows have been found abandoned by roadsides, and about 58,000 elderly dairy cows are awaiting slaughter.\n",
      "Last fall, after the mad cow outbreak, slaughterhouses and meat companies sought to unload frozen meat stocks in the face of plummeting consumer demand.\n",
      "The government finally announced that it would buy up the beef from cows slaughtered in the month after the first case of mad cow disease.\n",
      "Last month, a government audit found that about half of the frozen beef purchased under the program was either Japanese beef stored in warehouses prior to the mad cow outbreak, or low-cost beef imported from Australia and the United States, countries without mad cow disease.\n",
      "With Japan the largest destination for American beef exports, the American industry has begun an $8-million advertising campaign to reassure the Japanese about the safety of American beef.\n",

      "Injuries to opponents are not on St. John's wish list, but the relief was obvious yesterday after the Red Storm finally took advantage of such an opportunity in a 66-60 victory over a short-handed Georgetown team in a Big East contest televised throughout most of the country.\n",
      "Georgetown, until now nearly unbeatable in its new home at the MCI Center, lost because it could not contain Felipe Lopez for a full 40 minutes any more than it could compensate for the loss of two starters -- especially the 6-foot-11-inch center Jahidi White -- for the full length of a game.\n",
      "Lopez, limited to 4 points in the first half in a continuation of his uncomfortable season, found his touch in the second half, hitting 3 of 5 3-point attempts en route to a game-high 18 points, a performance that was nicely complemented by the play of Zendon Hamilton (11 rebounds, 10 points) and the revived senior guard Tarik Turner (13 points off the bench).\n",
      "Lopez, also comforted by a game away from what he called \"unfair\" New York fans who have taken to booing him and the team, relaxed enough to help St. John's end a two-game losing streak and improve to 10-6 over all and 2-3 in the Big East.\n",
      "\"In the first half, I was struggling with a lot of shots, fading away, being inconsistent,\" Lopez said.\n",
      "\"But the second half, everything just came to me\".\n",
      "After winning for the third time in six games, St. John's Coach Fran Fraschilla said: \"It was exactly what we thought it would be: ugly, intense, physical, both teams playing hard, a blue-collar, backyard street fight.\n",
      "We made some big shots in the second half, especially Felipe Lopez\".\n",
      "Georgetown fell to 8-5 and 2-4 in the conference despite the efforts of Trez Kilpatrick (16 points) and guard Kenny Brunner (15).\n",
      "\"We were a little bit afraid of Hamilton and Felipe because those kids can make big plays,\" Hoyas Coach John Thompson said.\n",
      "\"Those kids have worked hard, have struggled and have gone through a lot of changes in a lot of ways, but they are great players.\n",
      "But you always know they can make plays that can hurt you\".\n",
      "Lopez did that emphatically in the second half, first on a thunderous dunk set up by a pinpoint alley-oop pass from guard Collin Charles, putting St. John's up, 46-44, with seven and a half minutes left.\n",
      "It was one of a series of razzle-dazzle attempts as St. John's tried to break away from a series of failed 3-point efforts.\n",
      "\"It was just a hunch, and it worked,\" Fraschilla said.\n",
      "Yet Lopez did not abandon the 3-pointer, answering a layup by Georgetown's Daymond Jackson with what would be the first of his three baskets from long range in the next three minutes, and lifting St. John's to a 60-53 lead.\n",
      "Georgetown not only proved vulnerable to Lopez, but also to the loss of White.\n",
      "The Hoyas' leading rebounder broke a bone in his ankle during practice Thursday, and yesterday underwent surgery.\n",
      "White, who had been averaging 8.3 rebounds a game, is expected to miss six to eight weeks.\n",
      "\"We would have rather seen him out there without the injury,\" Fraschilla said.\n",
      "\"You never wish for anyone to get hurt, especially a senior\".\n",
      "Also missing was Hoyas point guard Shernard Long, who is averaging 9 points a game, because of what the team called academic concerns.\n",
      "While Thompson expressed sympathy for White and anger toward Long for \"letting his teammates down,\" St. John's simply expressed relief at finding a way to take advantage.\n",
      "In its previous game, the Red Storm could not get the best of a Louisville team that had lost its starting guard, Marques Maybin, to surgery.\n",
      "Before that?\n",
      "\"We played a game against Seton Hall when they were missing the Big East rebound leader in Jacky Kaba, and we went in there and we lost,\" said St. John's forward Tyrone Grant of a 61-59 defeat at Continental Arena on Jan.\n",
      "3.\n",
      "\"We learned from the Seton Hall game,\" said Turner, who ended a two-game banishment and filled in well after the freshman guard Ron Artest (13 points) sat down with four fouls in the final minutes of the game.\n",
      "\"Just because one of the key players on the other team is injured doesn't mean we're going to win automatically.\n",
      "We still have to go out and play hard.\n",
      "And that's what we did\".\n",

      "ALBANY -- Brian M. Kolb is not a power broker or a kingmaker, a rabble-rouser or a political bomb thrower.\n",
      "Perhaps his main claim to fame is his durability: Mr. Kolb has served 17 years in the State Assembly, about half that time as the leader for the influence-free Republican minority, acting as an articulate, if toothless, foil to the overwhelming Democratic majority.\n",
      "But on Tuesday, Mr. Kolb earned a note of distinction by becoming the first major-party candidate to formally declare a campaign to unseat Gov.\n",
      "Andrew M. Cuomo, whose formidable war chest and bruising political style have seemingly made other potential candidates wary to enter the 2018 race.\n",
      "The optimistic Mr. Kolb -- whose voice mail invites callers to ''have an incredible day'' -- doesn't see it that way.\n",
      "''The world we live in has been made up of the American dream, and part of the American dream is about trying to pursue opportunity,'' Mr. Kolb, 65, said in a phone interview.\n",
      "''And here's an opportunity to serve our state.''\n",
      "Mr. Kolb, who represents a district outside Rochester, was thought to be one of three potential Republican challengers to Mr. Cuomo, a second-term Democrat who has rumored presidential ambitions, favorability ratings in the 50s and tens of millions of dollars in the bank.\n",
      "One of those possible challengers, State Senator John A. DeFrancisco, an irascible Republican critic of Mr. Cuomo, appeared at an event on Monday in Albany alongside a possible Democratic candidate, the departing Syracuse mayor, Stephanie Miner, both of whom took the opportunity to bash Mr. Cuomo.\n",
      "Another possible Republican candidate -- one seemingly favored by many in the state's Republican leadership -- is Harry Wilson, a corporate turnaround expert who reiterated on Tuesday that he is near a decision.\n",
      "By being the first to declare, Mr. Kolb invited attention, not all of it positive.\n",
      "''Would a minority leader with a small 'm' who has had no power in his entire period in Albany, would he give Andrew Cuomo a hard time in a campaign?''\n",
      "said Hank Sheinkopf, a Democratic political consultant who has worked for the governor in the past.\n",
      "''Would an ant bother a bulldozer?''\n",
      "Mr. Sheinkopf did note that Mr. Kolb has been untouched by corruption, the most common crime among Albany lawmakers, an issue that may haunt the governor during next year's campaign: A roster of associates of Mr. Cuomo's are to face trial in 2018 on federal corruption charges, including Joseph Percoco, who was once the governor's closest adviser.\n",
      "And that timing seems to encourage Mr. Kolb.\n",
      "''A lot can happen next year,'' he said.\n",
      "The state's Republican chairman, Edward F. Cox, offered a respectful, if cautious statement about Mr. Kolb's candidacy.\n",
      "''We're glad he has formally announced his intentions,'' Mr. Cox said, before saying he was excited by the possibility of other candidates, too.\n",
      "''Governor Cuomo's corruption and mismanagement have failed New Yorkers and it's time for new, Republican leadership.''\n",
      "He added that the party would be ''working collaboratively with our county chairs over the coming weeks and months to put together the statewide ticket.''\n",
      "The Republican convention is next spring.\n",
      "Republicans haven't won a statewide race in New York since 2002, and demographics continue to be daunting.\n",
      "Democrats hold a more than 2-to-1 advantage in voter registration, and are expected to have a surge in interest in 2018 because of congressional elections and President Trump's unpopularity in the state.\n",
      "Still, Mr. Kolb said he had been encouraged by the showing of his fellow Assembly member, Nicole Malliotakis, a Republican from Staten Island, in the recent New York City mayor's race, saying he would be ''microtargeting voters'' in the city, and concentrating on issues like Mr. Cuomo's handling of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and his evergreen feuds with Mayor Bill de Blasio.\n",
      "''I think that that's where you start to pick up votes and the party registration starts to melt away pretty quickly,'' he said.\n",
      "For all that, Mr. Kolb said he recognized the long odds at beating Mr. Cuomo, but invoked the biblical story of David versus Goliath and the similarly themed Hollywood saga of Rocky Balboa as examples of underdogs winning the day.\n",
      "''It could be a movie someday,'' he said, ''if we pull this thing off.''\n",

      "Has America become a “Trumpocracy,” and is what we’re watching a tragedy or a farce?\n",
      "Ross Douthat, a Times Op-Ed columnist, and David Frum, a senior editor at The Atlantic and the author of “Trumpocracy: The Corruption of the American Republic,” debated these questions in an online discussion.\n",
      "ROSS DOUTHAT: David, thank you so much for joining me.\n",
      "Where this presidency’s first year is concerned, I think we represent two poles of conservative skepticism: I’ve been most worried about Donald Trump’s incapacity, the chance that we’ll stagger headless into some geopolitical disaster; in your book, you seem most worried about the president’s dictatorial tendencies, and you think that authoritarian danger is alive and well.\n",
      "What would you say to convince me that I’m underestimating the danger of Trump as cunning would-be despot, as opposed to just Trump as “chaos president”?\n",
      "DAVID FRUM: First, those differences may be less than you suppose.\n",
      "I’ve stressed over and over my belief that Trump is a kleptocrat first.\n",
      "He hates criticism and contradiction, yes, but he mostly seeks to plunder.\n",
      "In order to get away with the plunder — and also with his improper connections to Russia — Trump must in self-preservation turn off the “burglar alarms” of the American state.\n",
      "He has attacked the F.B.I. and other means of upholding public integrity.\n",
      "Very relevantly for your concerns, he has degraded the National Security Council and other foreign-policy decision-making arms.\n",
      "They get in his way on Russia.\n",
      "Which leaves us careening toward war in the Korean Peninsula blind and careless.\n",
      "DOUTHAT: But the reason for our aggressive Korean policy seems to be the policy views of H.R. McMaster, who may be deeply wrong about the issue but is nobody’s idea of a hack, crony or Trumpian toady; he’s the sort of figure who could be making policy in any G.O.P. administration.\n",
      "The absence of a serious, engaged and competent president may make the Korean situation more dangerous than it should be (plus all those warmongering tweets, yes), but it’s not clear to me that a Trumpian war on expertise is the driving force behind the brinkmanship.\n",
      "And meanwhile, on Russia policy, where is the pro quo that Trump is supposedly delivering to his Kremlin allies?\n",
      "It seems to me that our foreign-policy decision-making arms have mostly either left the status quo alone or, by selling arms to Ukraine, escalated from the Obama era positioning.\n",
      "FRUM: Here’s what the Russians have achieved.\n",
      "1) They blocked from office a capable and effective foreign-policy president who understood them, their aims and how to build effective coalitions against them.\n",
      "2) They gained a president who for reasons of vanity or worse has left the country vulnerable and exposed to further attack.\n",
      "3) They gained a president who is smashing apart America’s alliance structures.\n",
      "What intelligent South Korean can look for protection to the United States when its president regularly tweets that it is to China, not the United States, that South Korea should look for protection — and who is contemplating sacrificing hundreds of thousands of Korean lives to protect mainland U.S.A.?\n",
      "4) The Russians gained a United States that operates in ways they are comfortable with — open to corruption and oligarchy — and they have scored points for the argument that democracy is a joke and a fraud.\n",
      "5) They have helped install a racial provocateur who identifies every stress point in American political culture and inflames it to the point that the United States polarizes and paralyzes … I could go on.\n",
      "DOUTHAT: That the Russians have gained a president who may be seriously endangering America’s broad position in the world I don’t dispute.\n",
      "My argument is just that, so far, your intelligent South Korean could look at the actual moves made by the American state and persuade themselves — as many world leaders have seemingly persuaded themselves — that they should act as though McMaster and James Mattis and a few others are really running foreign policy, and the official president’s tweets are so much sound and fury.\n",
      "Likewise an intelligent Pole or Hungarian or Ukrainian, trying to make choices in the shadow of Putin’s ambitions: You just don’t see the kind of dramatic steps, with NATO or anything else, that would suggest that Trump is substantially changing American policy.\n",
      "Which is why despite our agreement about Trump’s character and competence, my general level of alarm has lowered somewhat since his inauguration, and is currently lower than your own.\n",
      "FRUM: The United States is a big bureaucratic state.\n",
      "Change more often comes to the United States by changing the content of the American state than by changing its forms.\n",
      "For example, the Constitution contemplates a cabinet system of government, with the principal officers confirmed by the Senate.\n",
      "Yet the chief of staff and the national security adviser, two positions never contemplated by the Constitution, matter more than any cabinet officer.\n",
      "On constitutional democracy’s periodic upswings, we develop expectations about how the president should behave that exceed the law — e.g., no Franklin Roosevelt Jr.’s doing shady deals from the White House — and we go into reverse on the downswing.\n",
      "Trump has not changed any law or policy about presidential financial integrity.\n",
      "He’s just ignored customs (publish his tax returns), rendered other laws meaningless (financial disclosures that conceal things the public most needs to know, e.g., the upstream debts of the Trump Organization) and simply defied other laws by official lying (the endless misstatements by Trump’s son-in-law and the nation’s de facto chief foreign affairs officer).\n",
      "DOUTHAT: I agree; this is a definite downswing, a return of certain kinds of presidential sordidness and their exacerbation on certain fronts.\n",
      "But part of what’s been striking about the Trump era to me is how much its events have confirmed trends that are bigger than Trump, that he benefited from during his ascent and that loom larger to me as symptoms of continuing crisis than most of the specific policy moves he’s attempted.\n",
      "In particular, the paralysis of Congress, it’s abdication of power to the presidency and its inability to function as a legislative body — plus the ideological sclerosis of the Republican Party, its collapse into an entertainment-wing-driven grift — these have been defining features of life under President Trump, as they were under President Obama before him.\n",
      "Were Trump an effective authoritarian, he could use these features of our politics to claim new powers and execute unilaterally on grand ambitions — as both of the last two presidents, on matters of war and peace and domestic policy, attempted and sometimes succeeded in doing.\n",
      "But his ineffectiveness so far means that the pre-existing crisis in how the presidency and the legislative branch relate to each other, and how the G.O.P. all functions, is still percolating, but not necessarily becoming dramatically more dire.\n",
      "FRUM: Your use of the word “unilaterally” casts a useful clarifying light on what may be the foundation of our disagreement.\n",
      "Let me be very clear what I do not mean by “Trumpocracy,” at least not yet: Caesarism.\n",
      "The authoritarian-nationalist system Trump is building is not being built against Congress, but with Congress — and even more, with Republican Parties at the state level.\n",
      "The big reveal to Republicans in the second Obama term, continuing now into the first Trump term, is that you and Reihan Salam and Ramesh Ponnuru and Henry Olsen and other “reformicons” were right on the politics of Paul Ryan-style conservatism: Such politics simply could not prevail in a free and fair democratic contest.\n",
      "You and they (and me, too) assumed, or at least hoped, that Paul Ryan’s party would respond to this better-late-than-never recognition of the obvious by moderating their policies.\n",
      "More health care, less immigration, more infrastructure, more family-friendly tax policy, etc.\n",
      "DOUTHAT: Right, and this is where I differ from many NeverTrumpers: On policy grounds, there is a sense in which I often wish that Trump were more effective in pushing the populist-nationalist brew from his campaign.\n",
      "Instead, those ideas (especially their non-xenophobic, economic manifestations) seem like something he never much cared about and will happily abandon if everyone else in the room prefers to repeal Obamacare instead.\n",
      "FRUM: Instead, they concluded: “What if we shaped the electorate to be a little more friendly to us?\n",
      "Might our formerly unpopular ideas prevail then?\n",
      "” The G.O.P. is complicit with Trump because he delivered a success that finer leaders and better methods could not deliver.\n",
      "Trumpocracy is the fusion of Trump’s authoritarian instincts with the G.O.P.’s plutocratic instincts in the context of a country trending in very different directions.\n",
      "DOUTHAT: I think that’s a plausible characterization.\n",
      "But again, those instincts have not, so far, produced massive voter disenfranchisement — just a voter fraud commission that went nowhere because it was run by incompetents.\n",
      "More broadly, the G.O.P. is relying on gerrymandering and Electoral College quirks and the concentration of liberal voters around big cities — but that kind of thing often happens in American politics, and so far it’s not producing big policy swings (Paul Ryan is not going to privatize Medicare in the next two years), just stagnation and the status quo, with the clear opportunity for the Democrats to take control of all three branches of government if they run smart campaigns in the next two years.\n",
      "The underlying situation isn’t good, for the country or for a healthy conservatism — but neither is there some authoritarian breakthrough happening that’s likely to save the G.O.P. from its unpopularity, let alone enable it to implement some full-on anti-welfare state agenda.\n",
      "FRUM: If your concern is for a seizure of power like the 18th Brumaire, then yes, you can relax.\n",
      "That’s not going to happen.\n",
      "It hasn’t happened in Hungary, it hasn’t happened in Poland, it hasn’t happened in South Africa, it won’t happen here.\n",
      "It’s out of style, counterproductive.\n",
      "“Massive” voter disenfranchisement of the kind seen in the U.S. South after 1876 also won’t happen.\n",
      "It’s too visible and too provocative.\n",
      "Modern authoritarianism is more economical.\n",
      "It will — it has — produced just enough disenfranchisement to get the job done without so much as to rev up so many people as to threaten the whole project.\n",
      "DOUTHAT: Perhaps, but it seems its own sort of complacency to assume that we couldn’t ever have a an 18th Brumaire-style coup … and also like an overestimation of the Trumpian varietal if its “economical” voter suppression can’t even manage to hold a safe-as-houses Senate seat in Alabama.\n",
      "FRUM: But look at what has already happened.\n",
      "Donald Trump fired an F.B.I. director for blatantly improper, self-serving reasons — and his entire party (and its supporting talkers on TV and radio and the op-ed pages) instantly coalesced on a brand-new theory that the president has an absolute discretionary right to fire the F.B.I. director at any time for any reason, including to protect himself from investigation.\n",
      "Nobody ever believed that before — indeed, the last time a president fired an F.B.I. director, Bill Clinton versus William Sessions, the president engaged in elaborate fact-finding and broad consultations with Congress and extended the director the opportunity to testify on his own behalf.\n",
      "And all this with Congress controlled by the president’s own party!\n",
      "Today, it’s the newly declared position of one of the parties (and who knows, maybe soon both parties) that the chief law enforcement officer of the United States is subject to presidential control and direction and removal for any reason, including self-dealing reasons.\n",
      "This is new.\n",
      "And it is dangerous.\n",
      "DOUTHAT: I’m not sure we’re quite there: Your “brand new theory” is the declared position of Sean Hannity and other Fox personalities and a clutch of noisy House Republicans, but so long as the Mueller investigation is proceeding apace, I think it’s more a norm in the balance, if you will.\n",
      "But I won’t argue that Trump isn’t a norm violator.\n",
      "I’m just not sure, in the absence of sweeping policy consequences, that his sleazy, sordid norm busting is categorically worse than, say, the way that both the Bush and the Obama White House changed norms about going after reporters and leakers, or the norm shifting after 9/11 that led to torture briefly being practiced by the C.I.A., or the norm shifting that gave us a disastrous Libya intervention that Congress never even voted on ever … let alone President Obama’s various norm-stretching power grabs on immigration, climate-change regulations and more.\n",
      "FRUM: As you know, I open my book by discussing the “pre-existing conditions” from which Trump emerged.\n",
      "My hypothesis is that the end of the Cold War opened the way to more uncertainty about America’s responsibilities abroad and more ruthless partisan competition at home.\n",
      "But it’s not a very reassuring answer to the complaint “We seem to have fallen to new low” to point out that we have been tumbling downstairs for a while.\n",
      "DOUTHAT: That’s fair, but if the danger was taking a header off the landing, and instead we’ve just rolled down a step or two, I’m not going to apologize for feeling a provisional relief.\n",
      "But to play us out here, let me test a thought I’ve had sometimes in the last year: We’ve been talking about the trend toward “Caesarism,” something I criticized harshly under Obama and feared Trump would exacerbate.\n",
      "But sometimes during the last year I’ve wondered if the “pre-existing conditions” are now bad enough that there simply isn’t going to be, say, a recovery of congressional effectiveness or a return to a healthy left-right dynamic without a kind of Caesarist interlude, of the kind America arguably had under Lincoln and under F.D.R., in which a dangerously strong president reshapes his party and the political process in ways that make it possible to pursue the common good again.\n",
      "In other words, Trump is the wrong kind of Caesar, but some version of what he represents, some authoritarianism-skirting leader, might in fact be a necessary figure for our polarized and increasingly dysfunctional politics.\n",
      "What do you think of that provocation?\n",
      "FRUM: Lincoln and F.D.R. expanded the presidency in ways that Donald Trump has not yet attempted, and is probably too idle, distracted and inept to execute.\n",
      "Lincoln and F.D.R. were also good and decent men — Lincoln, in fact, something high above ordinary ideas of goodness and decency — facing authentic emergencies and acting for the public good in ways not only ratified by history but also by the leading moral authorities of their own time.\n",
      "What you say above may describe the impending Oprah presidency, but not Trump’s.\n",
      "DOUTHAT: Well, then let’s discuss again under the spiritual-but-not-religious theocracy of Her Most Holy Oprahness.\n",
      "Thank you, David.\n",
      "It was a pleasure.\n",
      "FRUM: Thank you — and even more urgently let me finish with a wish that events prove you right and me wrong.\n",

      "ATHENS -- Huge demonstrations in Athens and Thessaloniki recently have shaken Greece's politics and threatened its coalition government.\n",
      "After years of austerity and the humiliation of depending on foreign loans, many Greeks are rejecting the idea of their country sharing the name of its northern province, Macedonia, with a small northern neighbor, the Republic of Macedonia.\n",
      "This decades-long controversy has undermined the role that Greece, as a member of the European Union and the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, could play in the Balkans.\n",
      "Even as a new government in the Republic of Macedonia's capital, Skopje, appears keen on compromise and United Nations-mediated negotiations intensify, the issue could drive Greece's domestic politics, as it has in the past.\n",
      "Since 1991, when the Socialist Republic of Macedonia voted to secede from the Yugoslav federation, Greeks have intermittently protested and lobbied vigorously abroad to prevent the new country of two million people from using the name ''Macedonia.''\n",
      "The country was admitted to the United Nations in 1993 under the provisional name of Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (the acronym formed by that name, Fyrom, is the safest way for any Greek politician to refer to the country).\n",
      "More than 25 years of diplomacy have failed to resolve the issue.\n",
      "But even though over 130 countries -- including the United States, Russia and China -- have recognized the Republic of Macedonia, the government in Skopje must get Athens's agreement to the name so it can join the European Union and NATO.\n",
      "In 1992, around a million Greeks attended a protest in Thessaloniki, the capital of the province of Macedonia, declaring that ''Macedonia is Greek and only Greek.''\n",
      "This prompted Greece's political leadership to reject any use of ''Macedonia'' by its neighbor, even in a compromise such as New Macedonia or Upper Macedonia.\n",
      "This rare show of unanimity left Athens no room to maneuver, and Skopje, too, did not back down.\n",
      "Greece got its partners in the European Union to support its hard-line position, but the lengthy status quo does not mean things were calm.\n",
      "Greece imposed a 20-month embargo on its landlocked neighbor, lifting it in 1995 when Skopje dropped an ancient Macedonian symbol from its flag.\n",
      "In 2008, Greece said it would not allow its neighbor to join NATO until there was agreement on the name.\n",
      "In Greece, the issue has remained a touchstone of patriotism, even when it isn't in the headlines.\n",
      "Any slip by a politician or commentator -- saying ''Macedonia'' instead of ''Fyrom,'' or suggesting the possibility of a compromise -- is met by furious reaction.\n",
      "Recent polls show that as many as 81 percent of Greeks still reject any use of ''Macedonia'' by their neighbor.\n",
      "The issue is long and complicated, like so many Balkan stories where national histories and geography overlap, and the past intrudes on the present.\n",
      "In this case, one nation is trying to forge an identity and preserve its territorial integrity, while the other is defending its history, cultural heritage and territory from what it believes are its neighbor's ambitions.\n",
      "The historical region of Macedonia was carved up after the Balkan wars early last century, after decades of fighting among Turks, Greeks, Serbs and Bulgarians.\n",
      "Just over half of the territory became part of Greece, while the rest went mainly to Serbia and Bulgaria.\n",
      "The ancient Macedonians -- of whom Alexander the Great was the most famous -- were a Greek tribe.\n",
      "Alexander lived in the fourth century B.C., some 900 years before Slavic tribes settled in the region.\n",
      "In the nationalistic fervor of the 19th and 20th centuries, Slavs who identified themselves as ethnic Macedonians pressed for a separate state, with Thessaloniki, Greece's second city, as its capital.\n",
      "Greek anger at their appropriation of the name, history and symbols of the ancient kingdom and fears of a renewed threat to its territory resurfaced as Yugoslavia disintegrated in the early 1990s.\n",
      "These fears may seem absurd, but they are not irrational.\n",
      "From 1941 to 1944, Bulgaria, allied with the Nazis, occupied part of northern Greece, including part of Macedonia.\n",
      "In the civil war that followed World War II, Greek Communists fought for an autonomous Macedonia that would have included the Greek province.\n",
      "More recently, the previous government in Skopje carried out acts of cultural appropriation, erecting statues of Alexander (but called, coyly, ''Equestrian Warrior'') and his father, Philip.\n",
      "In 2006, the capital's airport was named Alexander the Great -- a decision that the present government just decided to rescind officially.\n",
      "Still, both countries seemed content with the stalemate, as long as Skopje was gaining international recognition and Athens did not have to sell a compromise to voters.\n",
      "But the new government in Skopje is renewing the country's push to join the European Union and NATO, and both organizations believe that this will help stabilize the western Balkans.\n",
      "A European Union summit meeting in June and a NATO summit meeting in July of next year had been seen in both Skopje and Athens as deadlines for a deal, and last week the United Nations mediator Matthew Nimetz was shuttling between the two capitals.\n",
      "Any notion that quiet diplomacy would lead to a compromise, however, was dispelled by noisy declarations from the junior partner of Greece's government: Panos Kammenos, the leader of the Independent Greeks, said he would reject any deal that included the name ''Macedonia'' in any form.\n",
      "He has recently said that while he will not bring down the government, he will not back down on rejecting a compromise -- raising the question of whether Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras will dare to back a compromise.\n",
      "The odd coupling of the radical left-wing Syriza party and the nationalist right-wing Independent Greeks was based on their common opposition to the bailout agreements, despite their incompatible views on other issues.\n",
      "Syriza is the heir of a tradition of leftist parties that did not have a problem with recognizing a neighboring ''Macedonia.''\n",
      "Mr. Kammenos, though, will lose all legitimacy if he compromised.\n",
      "Drawing from a similar deep well of populism and suspicion of foreigners' intentions as the one that brought this coalition government to power, groups opposed to any compromise organized the mass rallies in Thessaloniki on Jan.\n",
      "21 and in Athens last Sunday.\n",
      "These brought together hard-line nationalists, Orthodox Church faithful and various factions opposed to the current government and its policies.\n",
      "The main opposition party, the conservative New Democracy, hesitated but in the end took a hard line against compromise, and several leading members attended the Athens protest.\n",
      "Accepting a compromise could lead to division within New Democracy and perhaps inspire a new party to form on its right.\n",
      "Consensus also would go against the tradition of political parties doing all they can to exploit one another's difficulties.\n",
      "The main speaker in Athens was Mikis Theodorakis, the popular composer who at 92 is a symbol of national pride and leftist resistance for the years he spent in prison and exile under right-wing nationalist governments.\n",
      "After attacking the government for its handling of the issue, he highlighted the nature of the stalemate.\n",
      "''The only solution, in my opinion, is to leave the people of Skopje believing in their own national myth while we remain faithful and unyielding with regard to the Greek nature of Macedonia,'' he said.\n",
      "''As long as we Greeks decline to harm ourselves in order to have the approval of the United States, NATO and Europe, we can continue with our lives as we have been doing for so many years.\n",
      "But this means we will reject any other concession.''\n",
      "He added, ''We will not, to the extent that we can, agree to their joining Europe and NATO.''\n",
      "The Macedonia issue combines a sense of victimhood with evidence of a real threat.\n",
      "However minor that threat may be, it confirms fears that others wish to usurp Greece's history, which we Greeks equate with our identity, and lay a claim to lands that have been fought over for centuries.\n",
      "In the Balkans, the past is never past.\n",
      "It drives the present.\n",

      "Nicanor Parra, a Chilean poet whose use of direct, colloquial and playful language, often for ironic and comic effect, pioneered the literary movement that became known as anti-poetry, died on Tuesday in Santiago, Chile.\n",
      "He was 103.\n",
      "The death was announced by President Michelle Bachelet, who called Mr. Parra ''a singular voice in Western culture.''\n",
      "An accomplished mathematician and physicist, Mr. Parra rose to fame in 1954 with the publication of his ''Poems and Antipoems,'' which used lucid language to evoke the humor and absurdity of modern life.\n",
      "He filled his poems with cliché and even slang, reflecting his interest in everyday speech as an expressive and descriptive medium.\n",
      "He used emotionally incongruent language -- much of it humorous, irreverent or banal -- to underscore the tragic nature of many of his compositions.\n",
      "Common objects like phones, soda fountains and park benches were sprinkled throughout his verse.\n",
      "''Laughter and tears'' was the way he described the technique of anti-poetry, a movement that was in part a response to the conventional notion of poetry as a form of elevated expression for elite readers, as found in the verse of his friend Pablo Neruda.\n",
      "''I always associated poetry with the voice of a priest in the pulpit,'' he once said, adding that poets sang while people talked.\n",
      "''Let the birds do the singing.''\n",
      "He told The New York Times in an interview in 1968, ''When there is humor, irony, sarcasm, when the author is making fun of himself and so of humanity, then the author is not singing but telling a story -- that is an anti-poem.''\n",
      "Regarding his relationship to the reader, he once said: ''Humor makes contact easier.\n",
      "Remember that it's when you lose your sense of humor that you begin to reach for your pistol.''\n",
      "The ready accessibility of his verse is reflected in a 1972 poem, ''Help!\n",
      ",'' here translated in its entirety by the Arkansas poet Miller Williams:  I don't know how I got here:  I was running along happy as you please  My hat in my right hand  Chasing a phosphorescent butterfly  Who drove me crazy with joy  And suddenly zap!\n",
      "I tripped  I don't know what's happened to the garden  The whole thing went to pieces  My nose and my mouth are bleeding.\n",
      "Honestly I don't know what's going on  Either give me some help  Or a bullet in the head.\n",
      "Matías Rivas, director of publications at Diego Portales University in Santiago, said Mr. Parra had tried to excise the flourishes and excessive wordiness of Latin American literature in favor of a ''frank poetry'' that gave ''voice to the popular classes.''\n",
      "He wanted, Mr. Rivas said, ''to lower the poets from Olympus.''\n",
      "Nicanor Segundo Parra Sandoval was born on Sept.\n",
      "15, 1914, in San Fabián de Alico, in southern Chile, one of nine children of Nicanor Parra, a schoolteacher and musician, and Rosa Clarisa Sandoval Navarrete, a dressmaker.\n",
      "The couple emphasized culture, and several of their children became respected artists, notably the folk singer Violeta Parra, who committed suicide in 1967.\n",
      "Mr. Parra published his first book, ''Singer Without a Name,'' a year before he graduated from the University of Chile in 1938, with degrees in mathematics and physics.\n",
      "He later studied mechanics at Brown University in Providence, R.I., and cosmology at the University of Oxford in England.\n",
      "He taught theoretical physics at the University of Chile for decades.\n",
      "''I do physics in order to earn my living, and I do poetry in order to keep alive,'' he told The Times in 1968.\n",
      "In 1963, he spent six months in the Soviet Union translating the work of several Soviet poets into Spanish, but he declined to join the Communist Party.\n",
      "For a time he was a darling of leftists in the United States -- though not in Chile, as he related in 1971, when he attended a birthday party for Bobby Seale, the Black Panther leader.\n",
      "Introduced by Jerry Rubin, the radical activist, as ''Chile's best poet,'' Mr. Parra, then 57, said he was viewed with suspicion by many Communists in Chile because of an episode in Washington in 1970.\n",
      "''I and some other foreign poets read at the Library of Congress,'' he recalled.\n",
      "''Afterward, we were taken to a reception at the White House and, before I knew it, I was shaking hands with Mrs. Nixon.\n",
      "Photographs of that appeared all over Latin America, and suddenly my old friends were very cold.\n",
      "I had to cancel a trip to Cuba.\n",
      "It is still very embarrassing.''\n",
      "Reviewing Mr. Parra's ''Emergency Poems'' in 1972, the scholar Alexander Coleman wrote that Mr. Parra and the other anti-poets ''dread the very idea of Poetry and its attendant metaphors, inflated diction, romantic yearning, obscurity and empty nobility.''\n",
      "His work was not to everyone's taste.\n",
      "One Chilean critic found the poems ''too dirty to be immoral.''\n",
      "Another reacted with ''pity and nausea.''\n",
      "In the early 1970s, he grew disillusioned with Chile's socialist president, Salvador Allende, the target of the short stories and poems Mr. Parra published under the title ''Artifacts'' (1972).\n",
      "The next year, Mr. Allende committed suicide as he was being overthrown in a military coup.\n",
      "Many leftists and artists fled, but not Mr. Parra, who retained his teaching position.\n",
      "(His nephew Ángel Parra, a celebrated singer-songwriter and the son of Violeta Parra, denounced his uncle, telling The Times, ''I want nothing from that man.''\n",
      ")  Among those who distanced themselves from Mr. Parra was Neruda, who was awarded the Nobel Prize for Literature in 1971 and died suspiciously in 1973, a short time after the coup.\n",
      "''Pablo always stood on a platform and his position was clear, but with Nicanor you never know,'' one of Neruda's friends told the literary scholar and biographer Frank MacShane for an article in The Times in 1976.\n",
      "Mr. MacShane said the contrast between the poets -- Neruda the Communist and Parra the skeptic -- was suggested by their houses in the seaside village of Isla Negra, on the Chilean coast: Neruda's mansion began as a stone house with a tower and was later extended along the bluff, while Mr. Parra's humble cottage was a few hundred yards inland, in a clump of pine trees.\n",
      "''None of the grandeur and sweep of Neruda is found in Parra's house,'' Mr. MacShane wrote.\n",
      "''It reflects a writer with quite a different stance -- a poet with modest but precise doubts and a laconic sense of humor.''\n",
      "He added, ''At heart Parra is an anarchist, a kind of exile from all society, including that of his own country.''\n",
      "Some of the poems in Mr. Parra's 1977 collection, ''The Sermons and Teachings of the Christ of Elqui,'' took aim at the human rights abuses carried out by the rightist regime of Gen.\n",
      "Augusto Pinochet.\n",
      "Shortly before the 1988 plebiscite that ended military rule and restored democracy in Chile, Mr. Parra was quoted in The Times as saying: ''We can write as we want, since the system pays no attention to our ordinary poetry.\n",
      "They know that nobody reads it.''\n",
      "Mr. Parra was awarded Chile's National Literary Prize in 1969 and the Cervantes Prize, the most prestigious literary award in the Spanish-speaking world, in 2011.\n",
      "He was given a Guggenheim fellowship in 1972.\n",
      "Mr. Parra spent his last years in Las Cruces, a small town on a bay near the Pacific Ocean, before returning to his family home in the La Reina section of Santiago.\n",
      "His marriages to Inga Palmen and Nury Taca ended in divorce.\n",
      "His survivors include six children: Catalina, Ana Francisca and Alberto, from a relationship with Ana Delia Troncoso; a son, Roberto, from a relationship with Rosita Muñoz, who had been his housekeeper; and two children, Colombina and Juan de Dios, from his marriage to Ms. Taca, a painter.\n",

      "If Ortiz, who was batting .\n",

      "IT'S 1963 as the third season of ''Mad Men'' on AMC gets under way next Sunday night.\n",
      "And its creator, Matthew Weiner, hopes the show stays on the air long enough to string out his story through the entire turbulent decade.\n",
      "''What I always wanted to do,'' he said in a phone interview from his office in Los Angeles, ''is to take this classic American archetype of the late 1950s, with all the trappings of that time, and see how he ends up in 1970 or '72.''\n",
      "This archetype is Don Draper (played by Jon Hamm), creative director at a midsize Madison Avenue ad firm, who has a nice house, a blond wife and two kids in the suburbs, and a life that's unraveling.\n",
      "In the first season, two years ago, we saw him having stormy affairs with exotic brunettes -- a Greenwich Village artist, then the daughter of a department-store owner.\n",
      "And we learned that his whole life, not just his job, is built on deception.\n",
      "During the Korean War, a fellow soldier was blown up in an attack and our hero stole his identity, to escape his own dead-end life, and he's kept it a secret ever since.\n",
      "''We live in a culture where people can transform themselves,'' Mr. Weiner said.\n",
      "''We have a phrase: 'Find a job, then become the person who does it.\n",
      "' Don is one of those people.\n",
      "It's a hard thing to swallow, because you're never really secure about yourself.\n",
      "For our hero that insecurity makes him especially good at understanding what people want and why they want it.''\n",
      "And that makes him a perfect ad man.\n",
      "In the new season we see this ultimate self-made man of midcentury America -- outwardly confident but hollow at the core -- smacked, like the culture he embodies, by the earthquake of the '60s.\n",
      "''I started off writing the show as a scathing analysis of what happened to the United States,'' Mr. Weiner said.\n",
      "''But the more I got into Don, the more I realized this is an amazing place.\n",
      "Something really did change in those years''  -- the late '50s and early '60s.\n",
      "''What would it be like to go to that place?''\n",
      "He continued: ''I'm interested in how people respond to change.\n",
      "Are they excited by the change, or are they terrified that they'll lose everything that they know?\n",
      "Do people recognize that change is going on?\n",
      "That's what the show's about.''\n",
      "''Mad Men'' has become one of those shows whose cultural weight exceeds the size of its audience.\n",
      "Despite an average audience of just 1.8 million viewers for each episode last season, it garnered more Emmy nominations this year (16) than any other series besides ''30 Rock'' (which had 22).\n",
      "It has spawned countless newspaper  and magazine articles on cocktail culture.\n",
      "Banana Republic is even featuring window displays inspired by its fashions and is handing out a ''Mad Men'' style guide.\n",
      "In the wake of ''The Sopranos'' and ''The Wire,'' ''Mad Men'' seems to fill a hunger for shows with grown-up themes, snappy (but not too snappy) dialogue, compelling multiple story lines, realistic settings, high production values (it's shot on 35-millimeter film) and characters, whether they're attractive or loathsome (or both), who have entirely credible motives.\n",
      "Mr. Weiner is notoriously secretive about new plot developments, an attitude that he acquired as a writer for ''The Sopranos,'' whose creator, David Chase, firmly prohibited leaks.\n",
      "But when asked if the season will touch on, say, the Kennedy assassination, he hesitated, then replied, ''We're going to handle everything.''\n",
      "The first season ended on Thanksgiving Day 1960, with Don's marriage in tatters and the soundtrack blaring Bob Dylan's ''Don't Think Twice, It's All Right,'' a song that didn't come out until 1963.\n",
      "''I didn't know if the show would be picked up,'' Mr. Weiner explained.\n",
      "''I was saying: 'Here's this song.\n",
      "This is what's coming.\n",
      "' ''  Season 2 ended in October 1962 with the peaceful resolution of the Cuban missile crisis and the tentative restoration of Don's marriage.\n",
      "For many Americans the missile crisis, was ''a near-death experience,'' Mr. Weiner said.\n",
      "''There was a tremendous anxiety that did not go away.\n",
      "People were unsettled by something.\n",
      "You can see it in all the accounts of that year.''\n",
      "Season 3 is about this anxiety.\n",
      "Without going into details he laid out some of the themes that serve as backdrops: sexual openness, urban renewal, fear of technology (especially atomic technology), environmental decay and overheated consumerism.\n",
      "Mr. Weiner listed some of the best-selling books of that time -- Rachel Carson's ''Silent Spring,'' Ralph Nader's ''Unsafe at Any Speed,'' Betty Friedan's ''Feminine Mystique,'' John Kenneth Galbraith's ''Affluent Society'' -- and said, ''The themes of these books come into the show and affect the characters' lives.''\n",
      "Matthew Weiner is 44, meaning the first three seasons of ''Mad Men'' take place in a time before he was born.\n",
      "But, he said, he's long been ''obsessed'' with that period.\n",
      "During his teenage years, in Los Angeles in the 1970s and early '80s, pop culture was drenched in '50s nostalgia -- bowling shirts, rockabilly, ''American Graffiti,'' ''Happy Days.''\n",
      "It also formed the real-life culture of his parents, who were married in 1959 and who filled their home with the era's artifacts.\n",
      "So young Matt devoured ''The Catcher in the Rye'' and ''Catch-22,'' sat glued to reruns of ''The Twilight Zone'' and read histories about the Beats and the Hollywood blacklist.\n",
      "''I saw the late '50s and early '60s as this golden age,'' he recalled.\n",
      "''The pop culture was so sophisticated.''\n",
      "Before receiving an M.F.A. at the University of Southern California's school of cinema and television, he studied philosophy, literature and history at Wesleyan University in Connecticut.\n",
      "And he would later weave much of what he read there into ''Mad Men.''\n",
      "John Cheever's short stories about midcentury suburbia were a major inspiration, but not Richard Yates's 1961 novel, ''Revolutionary Road,'' to which the series is often compared.\n",
      "Mr. Weiner had never heard of Yates when he wrote the ''Mad Men'' pilot in 2000.\n",
      "'' 'Revolutionary Road' was given to me three years after I wrote the pilot,'' he said.\n",
      "He says if he had read the book before, he wouldn't have had the nerve to write the show: ''Yates was there.\n",
      "This is what he was writing about.''\n",
      "Beyond its literary references and themes ''Mad Men'' has been most lavishly praised for its  meticulous period detail.\n",
      "''I read a lot from the period -- memoirs, novels, histories,'' Mr. Weiner said.\n",
      "To get the look of the time he collected personal photos and home movies, and watched the era's few films that were shot in the streets of New York, especially ''Sweet Smell of Success'' (1957) and ''Shadows'' (1959).\n",
      "Bob Shaw, the production designer for the ''Mad Men'' pilot, noted that magazine ads from an era are misleading sources of how people actually lived at the time.\n",
      "''The first premise I had,'' he recalled, ''was that no period exists purely as itself.\n",
      "People don't discard all their clothing.\n",
      "Very few people update their homes.''\n",
      "As a result Henry Dunn, the pilot's art director, said, ''Our choice of sets, furniture andclothes was based on research as much from the early '50s as from the late '50s.''\n",
      "So the pilot's first scene took place not in a ''cool '50s bar,'' as one producer suggested, but in a bar with an Old New York style.\n",
      "The Drapers live not amid high-modern decor but in a colonial home.\n",
      "''Don Draper is someone aspiring to an established lifestyle,'' Mr. Shaw said.\n",
      "''He's not breaking new ground.''\n",
      "If the series lasts as long as Mr. Weiner hopes, will Don finally break that ''new ground,'' or will he settle grumpily into the '70s backlash of Nixon's ''silent majority?''\n",
      "Will Sal come out of the closet after Stonewall?\n",
      "How will Peggy reconcile her career with motherhood?\n",
      "Mr. Weiner said he doesn't know right now how his stories end.\n",
      "Or at least he isn't saying.\n",

      "Over the years, scientists have developed many strains of genetically modified mice, many of which incorporate human versions of similar mouse genes.\n",
      "But there is something different in a recent experiment performed at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Leipzig, Germany.\n",
      "Scientists there have created a strain of mouse that contains the human variant of a gene, called FOXP2, associated with several critical tasks, including the human capacity for language.\n",
      "What makes this different is how fundamentally human -- and unmouse-like -- language really is.\n",
      "Something essential to us, something defining in our species, has been implanted in a rodent.\n",
      "FOXP2 happens to work pretty well in mice.\n",

      "The nerve cells they grow in one region of the brain are also more complex than those in unaltered mice.\n",
      "These may sound like modest results, but they are striking.\n",

      "What takes some getting used to is the idea of exploring what humanness really is -- how complex and how little understood -- by transplanting our genetic signatures, gene by gene, into other species.\n",
      "And there is another question hovering over this experiment: Just how alien to themselves do these transgenic mice become?\n",
      "To that question, scientists are bound to find no answers, until, perhaps, mice can speak for themselves.\n",

      "The government went back and checked its numbers -- back, in some cases, 60 years --  and on Friday it released the results, with changes big and small as the statisticians tried to calculate how well the economy had done and where Americans were spending their money.\n",
      "The results?\n",
      "The American economy was a little stronger than we thought when times were good, but worse when times were bad.\n",
      "The government decided that it should measure the impact of big disasters in a different way to avoid distortions in some statistics and that it had been overestimating the amount of consumer spending that goes to health care.\n",
      "The result was revisions in economic statistics going all the way back to 1947, when it turns out a downturn was a little deeper than had been thought.\n",
      "Some of those changes are the result of better data now being available, and a few represent conclusions by government statisticians that they had been making systematic errors -- one of which seems to have slightly exaggerated statistics on how much Americans were spending for energy.\n",
      "But other changes simply reflect changed decisions about how to count things.\n",
      "The apparent shrinking in medical care spending -- from 18.5 percent of personal consumption expenditures to 16 percent for the first quarter of this year -- stems from a decision to separate out the money that is paid to health insurers that does not eventually go to paying claims.\n",
      "The extra money from that, and from similar treatment of car insurance as well as other things, led to the creating of a new category of spending in personal consumption expenditures, for financial services and insurance.\n",
      "Those figures had previously been spread around many other items, and broken out only in a report that comes out on a delayed basis.\n",
      "In the new treatment, it appears Americans are spending more on financial services and insurance -- $823 billion a year at the current rate, or 8.2 percent of personal consumption spending -- than they are on food and beverages to be consumed at home -- $788 billion, or 7.9 percent.\n",
      "In early 1995, the earliest date for which revisions were released Friday -- more will be coming out later this year -- the positions were reversed.\n",
      "Then food and beverages took 9 percent of spending, and financial services drew in 7.2 percent.\n",
      "The revision to the medical care spending figures did not change the trend.\n",
      "Medical care took up 16.2 percent of spending in the second quarter of this year, up from 14.5 percent in the first quarter of 1995.\n",
      "Over all, the new figures are in line with a trend often seen when the data is revised: ''Benchmark revisions are in the direction of the inflection,'' said Robert Barbera, the chief economist of ITG.\n",
      "''The expansion was a bit better than they thought, and the recession was substantially worse.''\n",
      "During the period from the end of the 2001 recession to the fourth quarter of 2007, the new figures indicated the economy over all grew at an average annual rate of 2.7 percent, up a bit from the previously reported rate of 2.6 percent.\n",
      "But during the five quarters after that, through the first quarter of 2009, the economy declined at an annual rate of 4.2 percent, much worse than  the previously reported 2.8 percent fall.\n",
      "In general, we now learn that things that seemed bad before were actually worse.\n",
      "Investment in new home construction fell off at an even faster clip than was thought.\n",
      "Consumers cut back more than had been estimated, particularly in durable goods like  cars and furniture.\n",
      "The recession officially began in December 2007, according to the National Bureau of Economic Research, but for much of 2008 many economists disputed that, citing data that showed the economy to be still growing.\n",
      "But the new figures show a decline in the first quarter of 2008, and only a small gain in the second quarter, when the Bush administration's stimulus package of tax rebate checks caused a brief spurt in consumer spending.\n",
      "Another change in the numbers is the way that the government treats major disasters, like Hurricane Katrina.\n",
      "In the past, much of the losses showed up as reductions to corporate profits, which the government now views as misleading.\n",
      "As a result of the changes, total corporate profits in the third quarter of 2005, when that hurricane hit, are now reported at an annual rate of $1.2 trillion.\n",
      "That figure is 10.3 percent higher than the number the government had previously used.\n",
      "In the future, similar adjustments will be made for major disasters -- defined as causing damage of at least 0.1 percent of gross domestic product, or around $15 billion now.\n",
      "But smaller disasters will be treated in the old way.\n",
      "Under the old system, the uninsured value of destroyed assets was effectively subtracted from income, both for companies and for homeowners.\n",
      "That will still be true in most cases, but in really large disasters the extra costs will be placed in another account, known as consumption of fixed capital.\n",
      "The result will be that overall G.D.P. figures will not be changed, but corporate profits will be raised from what they would have been.\n",
      "The errors in energy were small, but still distorted the numbers.\n",
      "The government now says it was double-counting a tax paid by some electricity consumers and was estimating too much natural gas use by tenants in apartments where utilities are provided by the landlord.\n",
      "That cut the annual rate of consumer spending on energy goods and services to $495 billion, from $503 billion,  in the first quarter of 2009, bringing the percentage of personal consumption spending down to 5 percent, from 5.1 percent in the old data.\n",
      "In the second quarter, lower gasoline prices helped to bring the percentage down to 4.9 percent, the lowest level since 2004.\n",
      "According to the revised figures, consumer spending on energy  peaked in the third quarter of 2008 at 6.7 percent of total spending.\n",
